Manifest more abundance, accelerated healing, health, success, fitness, vitality, weight loss, equanimity, inner power, friendships, career success, spiritual breakthroughs, and love into your life effortlessly. Become a happier, healthier, and better version of yourself with your personalized Quantum Movies. With the intuitive, easy to use Quantum Life App, you get the tools to create your completely personalized Quantum Movie with congruency enhancing affirmations that have a direct impact on your subconscious mind.  We help you find where you are subconsciously blocking yourself from achieving wealth, fitness, weight loss, healing, health, success, love, happiness, self-confidence, self-worth, inner power, spiritual growth and/or connection and eliminate those blocks permanently. This will help you unlock your highest potential and attract what you really deserve while becoming the best version of yourself. Each Quantum Movie starts with selecting the areas and topic(s) you want to improve on. We have questions to help you define where you currently are in your life and where your focus needs to be. You can further specify your desires within those main topics and then you choose the duration of your Quantum Movie and the empowering affirmations to support the creation process. A Quantum Movie can be as short as 5 minutes or last up to 8 hours (so you can use it while sleeping to create inceptions of your desired future into your dreams, a technique developed by Drs. Joy and Roy Martina). You can also have the empowering affirmations running in the background while working, walking, or exercising.  During the Quantum Movie you will first dive into a deep hypnotic trance with sacred geometrical activations made by world renowned expert, Janosh. This will help you open your unconscious mind to the Quantum Field and activate your pineal gland and make it easier for you to manifest your heart’s desires into 3-Dimensional reality. After this short deep subliminal hypnotic trance, you will hear empowering affirmations synchronized with binaural beats and heart coherence inducing meditative music, customized photos and videos that suit your chosen topic(s).  You will feel, hear, see, and experience your desired future as if it is already your reality. By doing so you are creating precise alignment with the Quantum Field, which will manifest your dreams in the most effortless way (the law of resonance, also called the law of attraction). The Quantum Field follows the laws of resonance and effortlessness and must create the 3-Dimensional reality you resonate with. This is science not philosophy!

You me and the gatepost at some level at least, we’re all dancing to the quantum tune. If you want to explain how electrons move through a computer chip, how photons of light get turned to electrical current in a solar panel or amplify themselves in a laser, or even just how the sun keeps burning, you’ll need to use quantum physics.Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in Quantum Physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles.
