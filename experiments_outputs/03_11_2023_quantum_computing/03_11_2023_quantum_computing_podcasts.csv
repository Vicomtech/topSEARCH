Full Episode: https://spoti.fi/3s2q0Sa . Author of the Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU). CTMURadio.com,CTMU.com. The CTMU, which originated in the 1980's and remains the premier theory of mathematical metaphysics, can be succinctly described in several ways; for example, as a metaphysical (ontological, epistemological, and scientific) formulation of logic comprising a self-contained description of reality on its most general and basic level of existence. Chris has a new book coming out shortly. CTMU can elucidate the relationship between man and reality, enabling mankind to better accommodate and peacefully evolve within the reality we inhabit. The CTMU can also be described as a metareligion, or a theological metalanguage in which various bodies of religious belief can be convergently interpreted for purposes of spiritual unification. Thus, the CTMU has the potential to eliminate religious conflict and strengthen the Brotherhood of Man. The CTMU has been uniquely structured to serve as a true ""Theory of Everything"". The latter phrase ordinarily refers to a ""unified field theory"" in what is widely seen as the most fundamental of the empirical sciences, physics.

5xoSHwdKK3sgHa8l1mSB52,John Preskill: From the Early Universe to the Future of Quantum Computing,2023-02-17,"John Preskill is the Richard P. Feynman Professor of Physics at Caltech, a title many physicists would cherish.  He is widely known in the field for his work as a theoretical physicist spearheading the field of Quantum Computing, where he is Director of Caltech’s Institute for Quantum Information and Matter, but his expertise and contributions span a far broader spectrum of topics. His background is in theoretical particle physics, gravitation, and cosmology. As a graduate student, his seminal work on the cosmological implications of magnetic monopoles in Grand Unified Theories helped lead Alan Guth to develop his theory of Inflationary Cosmology, in part to resolve a cosmological conundrum John first elucidated.   Since that time, John has explored condensed matter systems and the physics of black holes, made a famous bet with Stephen Hawking, and coined the term “quantum supremacy”, to describe a metric that might reveal the first time a quantum computer resolved a problem that a classical computer could not resolve in a feasible human timescale.   As Director the Caltech Institute, John leads one of the most vibrant programs exploring quantum information and quantum computation, and I was happy to have the opportunity to connect again with my old friend and colleague to discuss this rapidly evolving field, about which so much is written in the popular press, and which may impact on all of our lives in the 21st century. In our discussion we tried to separate the wheat from the chaff, to discuss the future of the field, its current state, and challenges and opportunities.  In addition, we discussed his own scientific career and the physics areas that have excited him, and what helped drive him to become a physicist in the first place.  It was a fascinating discussion and I am sure you will be both entertained, and enlightened. As always, an ad-free video version of this podcast is also available to paid Critical Mass subscribers.

3JxMvA8qsW9W5jofuJbqIp,Neutral atom arrays with Alex Keesling of QuEra Computing,2023-10-02,"In this episode, Kevin and Sebastian are joined by Alex Keesling, CEO of QuEra Computing, for a discussion about his work with neutral atom arrays for simulation and computation. Alex describes his very early introduction to quantum information science as a high school student in Mexico, which kicked off a defining fascination with the field. At MIT as an undergraduate he started working with photonic systems, and as a PdD student with Misha Lukin at Harvard he played an instrumental role in the ""atom array"" project that eventually was spun out as QuEra. Today, QuEra's Aquila device has 256 atoms in its array that can be used as for analog Hamiltonian simulations, and is accessible on the cloud via AWS' Braket service. Alex explains in detail how these devices work, what physics breakthroughs they rely on for their operation, and where they may be going in the future with work underway on digital gates for universal computation. Additionally Alex takes us through some of the incredible scientific results these devices have already made possible, and discusses what the future of both scientific and commercial applications might hold. The QuEra team published a deep dive into their Aquila device and its capabilities in a paper called Aquila: QuEra's 256-qubit neutral-atom quantum computer. ",54.18,https://open.spotify.com/episode/3JxMvA8qsW9W5jofuJbqIp,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2023-10-02

However, despite this promise, there have been few applications that can only be accomplished by a quantum computer. Now though, researchers show that a quantum computer can resolve a physics problem concerning the orientation of quantum particles in a 2D material, which is difficult to accomplish with a ‘regular’ machine. They hope that this shows how quantum computers could be applied in real world research applications in the near future.Nature News: IBM quantum computer passes calculation milestoneResearch article: Kim et al.News and Views: Quantum computer scales up by mitigating errors10:11 Research HighlightsHow some bacteria turned their defences into weapons, and a forecast of how quickly arctic sea ice will disappear.Research Highlight: Cholera bacteria turn slime into an offensive weaponResearch Highlight: The Arctic could go ice-free in less than a decade12:45 How psychedelics might work in the brainPsychedelics are a group of drugs that affect perceptions of consciousness, and are of increasing interest in the treatment of conditions like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addiction. However, a lot is unknown about how they affect the brain. Now, researchers have shown that these varied drugs may have a shared mechanism: making the brain more able to forge new connections between synapses.

In an era where quantum computing is quickly evolving from theoretical research to practical application, Rob Hays comes forward with an impassioned perspective on why the United States needs to lead the global race in this pivotal technology.  As we unpack his views, you will discover a detailed roadmap that includes increased public funding, diversified investment strategies, and the essential role of government partnerships. Rob and I also tackle the increasingly important topic of talent acquisition and retention in the burgeoning field of quantum technologies. The conversation illuminates the U.S.'s struggles and opportunities as it attempts to maintain a competitive edge, particularly when pitted against international rivals in the technology sector. However, this isn't merely about a race but the consequences of who crosses the finish line first. We will explore the monumental economic value and the array of industries that stand to benefit from large-scale quantum computing. Moreover, we will touch upon the implications of new rules under consideration by U.S. Treasury officials that could restrict the flow of investments and knowledge to foreign companies, particularly in China, which is making strides in semiconductors, AI, and quantum computing.

1lebujoxnMk2ik1uAiiOaL,How to Quantum Shift / Quantum Jump: A Path to Energetic Freedom | Ep 215,2023-10-12,"Learn More About Quantum Shifting: CLICK HEREAI Description of EpisodeAre you ready to break free from your 'energetic Groundhog Day'? Wondering how quantum physics intersects with spirituality? This episode of 'Traveling to Consciousness' is a journey into the mystifying world of quantum shifting and quantum jumping. We'll demystify the concept of 'quantum' for you, drawing fascinating connections to the popular Marvel series to bring this abstract idea to life. You'll discover that quantum shifting isn't exclusive, but rather a universal skill we unknowingly engage in every day. Just like Bill Murray's character in Groundhog Day, we too are caught in an energetic loop, and only through becoming aware and shifting our internal energies at a quantum level can we free ourselves. By the end, you'll understand what it means to consciously quantum shift and how to harness this power in your daily life. Whether you're a quantum shifting novice or an enthusiast, there's something valuable for you here!Intro/Outro Music Producer: Don KinIG: https://www.instagram.com/donkinmusic/Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/44QKqKsd81oJEBKffwdFfPSuper grateful for this guy ^Support the showFREE 999 Meditation Challenge: Sign Up HereLearn How to Quantum Shift Your Reality: APPLY HERE",20.88,https://open.spotify.com/episode/1lebujoxnMk2ik1uAiiOaL,['en-US'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['meditation'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2023-10-12

15Umfe8CnXAwv6IgqR3Th5,What is a quantum computer?,2022-06-17,"Every year, new computers are being developed that are faster and smarter than ever before. But if you really want to take things to the next level, you've got to go quantum. CrowdScience listener Atikah in Hungary likes the sound of a quantum computer but wants to know: what exactly is it, what can it do that a normal computer can't, and how soon can she get hold of one?  The digital devices in our everyday lives - from laptop computers to smartphones - are all based on 0s and 1s: so-called ‘bits’. But quantum computers are based on ‘qubits’ - the quantum 0s and 1s that are altogether stranger, but also more powerful. With the help of quantum computing researcher Jessica Pointing and a spinning doughnut, presenter Alex Lathbridge learns how these ‘qubits’ allow computers to perform calculations millions of times faster than normal.  While quantum computers do exist, it turns out they're not yet big enough or stable enough to be really useful. Alex visits Professor Winfried Hensinger and his prototype quantum computer at the University of Sussex to understand what they can do right now, and why it’s so incredibly difficult to scale them up. He hears from the engineers racing to overcome the obstacles and unlock the potential of these mega-powerful systems.  But once the engineering problems are solved, what then? Professor Shohini Ghose opens our eyes to the exciting range of possible applications - from helping create new drugs, to making electric batteries much more efficient and maybe even helping farmers fertilise their crops for a fraction of the price.

Distinguished Scholar, US Library of Congress",2023-10-31,"“So it's hard to tell exactly what the dangers are, but that's certainly one thing that we need to track that beings that are vastly intellectually superior to other beings may not respect the weaker beings, given our own past. It's really hard to tell exactly what will happen. The first concern I have is with surveillance capitalism in this country. The constant surveillance of us because the US is a surveillance capitalist economy, and it's the same elsewhere in the world, right? With Facebook and all these social media companies, things have just been going deeply wrong. And so it leads me to worry about how the future is going to play out. These tech companies aren't going to be doing the right thing for humanity. And this gets to my second worry, which is how's all this going to work for humans exactly? It's not clear where humans will even be needed in the future.”Will AI become conscious? President Biden has just unveiled a new executive order on AI — the U.S. government’s first action of its kind — requiring new safety assessments, equity and civil rights guidance, and research on AI’s impact on the labor market.

2GH9SFBjKJQyackl5yEa1q,Episode 297: Quantum Cryptography Part 2 with Or Sattath,2023-11-01,"In this week’s episode, Anna (https://twitter.com/annarrose) and Nico (https://twitter.com/nico_mnbl) interview Or Sattath (https://twitter.com/or_sattath), Assistant Professor at the Ben-Gurion (https://cris.bgu.ac.il/en/persons/or-sattath) University in the Computer Science department. This is the 2nd episode with Or on this show, continuing the conversation around Quantum Cryptography. This time, he describes how we can transition from a pre-quantum to a post-quantum environment, looking at existing systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum. He covers why the methods used in the transition will be important, techniques on how this could be executed and the challenges in designing these techniques and the complications that can arise. Finally, they go on to discuss Quantum Money and recent works in this area. Here’s some additional links for this episode: Part 1 - Episode 288: Quantum Cryptography with Or Sattath (https://zeroknowledge.fm/288-2/)  Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Prime Factorization and Discrete Logarithms on a Quantum Computer by Shor (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9508027)  Shor’s Algorithm (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/guide/shors-algorithm)  Grover’s Algorithm (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/guide/grovers-algorithm)  A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search by Grover (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605043)  Fawkescoin: A cryptocurrency without public-key cryptography by Bonneau and Miller (https://jbonneau.com/doc/BM14-SPW-fawkescoin.pdf)  Bitcoin is not quantum-safe, and how we can fix it when needed by Buterin (https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-is-not-quantum-safe-and-how-we-can-fix-1375242150) Cryptographic canaries and backups by Justin Drake (https://ethresear.ch/t/cryptographic-canaries-and-backups/1235)  Notes and recommended links by Or Sattath: NIST post-quantum standardization (https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography) for post-quantum digital signatures and public-key encryption (or, more precisely, Key Encapsulation Mechanism, KEM). These are classical schemes that, unlike almost all the existing schemes that are used in practice, are secure against quantum adversaries.   Signature Lifting (arXiv link) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06754) is discussed as a technique to migrate to post-quantum signatures, especially for those who didn't prepare in advance. Here's a recommended Twitter thread (https://twitter.com/DesheShai/status/1635599973269098499) summarizing the results by Shai Wyborski, Or’s co-author. An approach to upgrade Bitcoin to quantum money is available here (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11998). This uses a cryptographic primitive which is called quantum lightning, which was introduced here (https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1080.pdf). Some smart contacts capabilities can be supported (https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12806) as well. This construction is based on one-shot signatures (https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/107), which isdiscussed in some detail during the interview. The bottom line of this work is that we can have the most important utility that Bitcoin provides, without the need for a blockchain, or any other consensus mechanism.  Uncloneable cryptography (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14265) was discussed during the interview. Quantum encryption with certified deletion (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03551) was discussed as an interesting example of a property that can be achieved only in quantum cryptography.

34gYqLkttW2NCnG6qy5lJV,The Quantum Theory of Computation and Developing Constructors to Revolutionize Computing with Chiara Marletto,2021-05-19,"Where can quantum computing take the next step to continue improving and begin outperforming current computers. Theoretically, physical transformations may be the next stage of development.  Listen up to learn:  The basic unit of quantum computation The challenges that face quantum computation development If biological systems can be emulated in quantum computers  A Research Fellow working in the Physics Department of the University of Oxford, Chiara Marletto, joins the conversation to discuss the quantum theory of computation. While our current understanding of computers focuses mainly on speeding up and bolstering computing power, research leads quantum computational researchers in a new direction. Constructors theoretically have the capability to modify shape within the laws of physics and appear to be on the horizon for quantum computing. Constructor theory relies on solving the problems from the current generation of computing machines, such as the noise, need for cold, and computational powers. What sets constructors apart from classical computers is the possibility of self-reproduction and a wide variety of other previously thought to be impossible tasks.

01m5hA7G4fgKr9hKl5Y1Ui,Quantum computing could be a critical climate solution,2021-12-16,"What exactly counts as “climate tech”? Basically all human activity is responsible for emissions, directly or indirectly. So nearly every new technology trend or capability has at least some role to play in curbing those emissions. Robotics? Sure. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, of course. Synthetic biology? Definitely.  But here's a really interesting one: quantum computing.  Mark Cupta is convinced it may actually be one of the most important technologies we'll invent to mitigate climate change. Mark is a partner at Prelude Ventures, a climate-focused venture capital firm, and he’s made multiple investments in quantum-computing companies.  Shayle and Mark talk about how it might unlock climate-tech breakthroughs that would otherwise take decades of brute-force PhD power. They talk about applications for new materials, battery and fuel chemistries, and synthetic biology. It could also help to solve optimization problems to improve the efficiency of logistics and operations.  Although quantum computing may not itself reduce carbon emissions in a huge way, it could essentially enable other critical technologies that we need to fight climate change.  Catalyst is a co-production of Post Script Media and Canary Media.

3zzlLhLKsnHHeuJhS9lObj,Quantum Computing: Foundational Concepts with Nick Bronn,2022-08-02,"Key Takeaways:[8:25] Nick Bronn does a quick introduction about himself.[9:23] At what point in Nick’s academic career did he find he was attracted to quantum computing rather than the condensed matter physical started to get drawn into the field?[13:27] When Nick joined IBM, did they have a functioning superconducting qubit? Was there a transmon that was operational at that point? Or was it still building the first one in IBM?[17:23] How a transmon qubit does its thing?[20:27] Nick explains the DiVincenzo criteria.[25:25] Nick explains how you can build whatever wavefunction you want with transmon qubits.[28:40] Nick mentioned transitioning from experimental to more, such as the theory and the software. What was the motivator for Nick to get more involved in how to program these things?[33:43] How would Nick recommend somebody who has not done a few decades in the lab doing the kind of necessary work to acquire his intuition on factors and what kind of budget they should have for certain resources to know to avoid one idiom of code versus another? [36:27] Is there a way to encourage people to include a Jupyter Notebook with their code in the papers they post to the arxiv?[41:25] Nick shares about his work in trying to actually create Majorana braiding on the superconducting qubits.[46:10] Nick talks about other techniques such as variational algorithms.[48:14] What are we going to see in the short to medium term, what will the big breakthroughs be? [51:01] Nick is trying to simulate Majoranas state using the qubits. Would there be any learnings there or applications that would help in terms of error mitigation or error correction? [53:33] Nick shares his thoughts on Majoranas and the very strong theoretical justification for their existence. [56:16] Nick encourages physicists to learn to code, and developers to learn physics.[58:01] Sebastian and Kevin share the highlights of an amazing conversation with Nick Bronn.LinksNick's video on error correctionDiVincenzo's criteriaQiskit site, an incredible resource for learning!The paper Nick mentioned by Bryce Fuller and Antonio Mezzocapo, Second-quantized fermionic operators with polylogarithmic qubit and gate complexityThe paper where Nick collaborated with David Pekker on simulating Majorana braiding on IBM's superconducting qubits. Tweetables and Quotes:“We're supposed to think about quantum computers as being a digital type of thing, you have these fundamental universal gates set, and that is not necessarily a continuous thing. But if you understand how the physics of these microwave operations work, then sometimes you can frame certain problems in a more efficient way, and reduce the overall amount of error that you incur.” — Nick Bronn“We do have a large community of quantum computing users. And, and it's kind of, it's moving so fast that it's not even, it's not very easy to kind of convey what the best way to do everything is, l there's no standard operating procedure, no kind of best practices.” — Nick Bronn“Physicists are not good coders, but just know enough to be dangerous.” — Nick Bronn“What is incredibly interesting about the condensed matter of physics is that they allow you to understand the properties of materials, even crazy materials, like superconductors with relatively simple models.” — Nick Bronn",64.07,https://open.spotify.com/episode/3zzlLhLKsnHHeuJhS9lObj,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2022-08-02

4Yjm1iycRnkUWXc3rg4xJP,Probability First: Understanding Quantum Computing with James Whitfield,2023-04-10,"Welcome to another episode of The New Quantum Era Podcast hosted by Kevin Rowney and Sebastian Hassinger. Today, they are joined by James Whitfield, who's a professor at Dartmouth College and is a colleague of Sebastian’s at Amazon Web Services’ quantum team. James has a quantum chemistry background, and, as a result, he brings that sensibility to his work in quantum information science.In today’s episode, they cover three main topics: They talk about the specific areas of quantum chemistry where progress in quantum computation can be seen towards cracking key problems. They address the intuitive nature of perceiving entanglement within quantum states and how those manifest in quantum algorithms (excellent material for people trying to get on top of that challenging concept). James shares his perspectives on enhancing pedagogy in Quantum Information Science, both in the K -12 range and at the graduate level.  Key Takeaways:[4:06] James talks about his background.[6:37] What's the simplest way to explain what quantum chemistry is?[8:18] James shares framing remarks on the merit of quantum computing in these early phases regarding its applicability to physical chemistry. [10:30] James talks about the concept of time evolution.[11:13] James explains the differences between the dynamical nature and the optimization nature of a problem.[13:06] James speaks of what happens inside of quantum time evolution.[14:54] Geometry optimization is only one problem that people discuss.[16:47] James talks about the ‘clamped nuclei’ approximation.[17:33] James describes the two ways of thinking about the Schrodinger equation.[19:59] What types of things would we be able to do if we could model time intervals? [24:09] Does James think that, in terms of time evolutions,  fairly large numbers of fault-tolerant qubits are needed to do useful calculations? Or is there a class of problems that NISQ or even Analog Devices like QuEra could be helpful with?[27:13] What is entanglement entropy? And what does that mean for computation?[30:48] Why do people believe in the extra power of quantum computing?[32:37] James defines coherence and decoherence.[34:25] James explains why measuring the growth rate of entanglement entropy over time is one way to capture the richness of the other quantum state.[36:42] James talks about the application of quantum chemistry.[42:55] James believes that, eventually, these will all converge.[43:54] James shares one of his projects about how we use quantum computers to benchmark what people do today.[45:37] The hard part is not the implementation; James explains why.[47:53] James uses the analogy of the robotics challenge.[48:41] James talks about the event called: Quantum Computing Quantum Chemistry Benchmark. 2023.[49:25] Is there an optimum starting point for quantum education? [52:45] James works with no negative probabilities.[55:05] James talks about quantum mechanics and atomic physics.[56:25] Quantum and AI often get grouped into the same category in terms of technology.[57:46] James shares what he enjoys the most about his work.[59:30] Does James think that eventually, software will eat all of these disciplines of science related to quantum information, and we will end up with scientists writing code, and that code will solve problems in chemistry, physics, or other scientific areas through writing software?[1:02:40] Kevin and Sebastian share the highlights of a fantastic conversation with James Whitfield.Mentioned in this episode:Visit The New Quantum Era PodcastComputational Complexity in Electronic Structure James Whitfield, Peter J.

2NQqGkpti1j9ndZHP3iAgj,John Preskill: From the Early Universe to the Future of Quantum Computing,2023-02-17,"John Preskill is the Richard P. Feynman Professor of Physics at Caltech, a title many physicists would cherish.  He is widely known in the field for his work as a theoretical physicist spearheading the field of Quantum Computing, where he is Director of Caltech’s Institute for Quantum Information and Matter, but his expertise and contributions span a far broader spectrum of topics. His background is in theoretical particle physics, gravitation, and cosmology. As a graduate student, his seminal work on the cosmological implications of magnetic monopoles in Grand Unified Theories helped lead Alan Guth to develop his theory of Inflationary Cosmology, in part to resolve a cosmological conundrum John first elucidated.   Since that time, John has explored condensed matter systems and the physics of black holes, made a famous bet with Stephen Hawking, and coined the term “quantum supremacy”, to describe a metric that might reveal the first time a quantum computer resolved a problem that a classical computer could not resolve in a feasible human timescale.   As Director the Caltech Institute, John leads one of the most vibrant programs exploring quantum information and quantum computation, and I was happy to have the opportunity to connect again with my old friend and colleague to discuss this rapidly evolving field, about which so much is written in the popular press, and which may impact on all of our lives in the 21st century. In our discussion we tried to separate the wheat from the chaff, to discuss the future of the field, its current state, and challenges and opportunities.  In addition, we discussed his own scientific career and the physics areas that have excited him, and what helped drive him to become a physicist in the first place.  It was a fascinating discussion and I am sure you will be both entertained, and enlightened. As always, an ad-free video version of this podcast is also available to paid Critical Mass subscribers.

3LZTtoKVjCVTbxotqrzHin,The Latest in Quantum Technologies with Doug Finke,2020-04-14,"The founder of The Quantum Computing Report, Doug Finke offers listeners a perfect distillation of the basics of  quantum computing alongside the latest advances.  He describes  The two twentieth century physics advancements  quantum computing uses, namely entanglement and super-positioning and what they are, The challenges of  quantum computing including the error rate, qubit de-coherence, and crosstalk alongside physical requirements such as the intense cooling, and  Current  quantum computing industry issues, including the lack of a shared computing language and the attempts to reach a  ""quantum advantage,"" a step that will bring quantum computing into the commercial field.   Doug Finke has been involved in computing for over 30 years, following industry elements such as semi-conductors, the storage industry, and more. His research and reporting have helped drive the growth of  quantum computing. In this podcast, he discusses the differences between classical computing and quantum technologies.  First, he explains that our classic computers are based on the physics of the 1800s. He adds that in the 20th century, scientists like Einstein and Heisenberg came up with quantum mechanics—physics that involves entanglement (where two things are linked) and super positioning (can hold a mixture of 0 and 1 at same time). Classic computers of today don't take advantage of that phenomena, he explains, but quantum technologies and  quantum computing do.   He adds more about the probabilistic form of the answers derived from  quantum computing, the need therefore for carefully crafted algorithms, and the accompanying issues of error rates and why. Along the way, he describes the special nature of a qubit and how it holds all of these technologies. He finishes by addressing current industry directions, the possibility of  quantum computing commercialization, and what type of access the average user may have.

You don’t want to miss his answers to my patented Thrilling Three final questions!  John Preskill is the Richard P. Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology, where he is also the Director of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter. He is one of the most prolific and influential scientists of our time. Preskill is a leading scientist in the field of quantum information science and quantum computation, and he is known for coining the term “quantum supremacy.”  Preskill studied magnetic monopoles in Grand Unified Theories. This work pointed out serious flaws in the then-current cosmological models, a problem which was later addressed by Alan Guth and others by proposing the idea of cosmic inflation. He’s the Director of the Institute for Quantum Information at Caltech. He is known for coining the term “Quantum Supremacy” in a 2012 paper. Preskill has achieved some notoriety in the popular press as a party to a number of bets involving fellow theoretical physicists Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne.

Yuval Boger, Chief Marketing Officer at QuEra, joins us to cut through the fog surrounding this emerging field. QuEra, a visionary Boston-based company founded by luminaries from MIT, has set out to transform quantum computing from a theoretical wonder to a practical tool for solving real-world problems. The crux of our conversation orbits around the timeline of quantum computing's contributions to real-world business applications. While the technology has been enveloped in a whirlpool of hype over the years, Yuval provides a sober perspective on when quantum solutions might genuinely disrupt industries like finance, oil and gas, and government research.  Yuval offers a nuanced view of how quantum processors will coexist with traditional CPUs and GPUs. The key takeaway is that rather than upending the computational apple cart, quantum will supercharge certain calculations and unlock problems beyond the reach of classical computing systems. By the end of our conversation, it becomes apparent that while quantum computing is undoubtedly a revolution in the making, it's a revolution that will integrate with, rather than overthrow, existing technological infrastructures. For companies and individuals willing to grasp its complexities and nuances, quantum computing offers opportunities that could redefine problem-solving in the 21st century.",22.06,https://open.spotify.com/episode/17KQbudNUl1yffjhrEm6Mm,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2023-09-14

Stephanie describes herself as a “quantum native” - she was a huge nerd growing up and was upset that her parents only introduced her to programming at age nine! She came across quantum when she was 16 and has been heads down into it ever since. She is looking forward to a future with many more quantum natives!  Her perspective is that human progress is always anchored in the commercialization of various branches of physics – which has led us to where we are today exploring quantum!  Photonic is working the middle ground between silicon photonics and silicon spins to create a silicon spin interface. Since spin qubits are essentially unpaired electrons, they are brilliant qubits. This approach will allow users to fill rooms with modular rack-mountable devices that can scale across a whole data center.

How David DiVincenzo got into quantum computing,2023-05-12,"In this episode, we talk to David DiVincenzo, Director of the Institute of Theoretical Nanoelectronics at Forschungszentrum Jülich & co-founder of the Institute for Quantum Information which is a joint institute of RWTH Aachen and the Forschungszentrum. We start by listening to David's take on different aspects of the fast developments in the field of quantum computing. Then, we take a deep dive into the mid eighties and early ninties and discuss how David started working on quantum computing before Shor’s algorithm and quantum error correction were discovered. Naturally then, him and his collaborators at IBM were ready to contribute to the developing field. We touch upon the DiVincenzo criteria and the Loss-DiVincenzo quantum dot proposal and get to know some of the mentors David was lucky to have had.",76.58,https://open.spotify.com/episode/369BhcjHaWJlECb9MYIqQf,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2023-05-12
1LndNyBKCotbffqgDy2y6O,The Quantum Mathematician,2018-03-13,"Quantum science has been one of the most successful and useful theories ever invented. Indeed quantum technology was added as the ninth of the original eight great technologies. However, quantum mechanics is also, at the same time, one of the most mysterious, and in many ways most bizarre of all scientific theories. Some of the maths of quantum science will be explained, demonstrating its vital role in modern technology. We will also look at its applications to quantum computing and ask questions about how this may change the way that we do computations in the future.The transcript and downloadable versions of the lecture are available from the Gresham College website: https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-quantum-mathematicianGresham College has been giving free public lectures since 1597.

6WmccqWGrB4AJR1IzYNWGa,Episode 939 - Oct 29 - 2023 - Quantum computing - Vina Technology at AI time,2023-10-30,"AI and quantum computing The interplay between AI and quantum computing takes multiple forms: How can AI improve quantum computing? AI techniques such as machine learning can aid in optimising quantum algorithms, making them more efficient. AI can also streamline the analysis, modelling, and optimisation of quantum circuits, reducing the number of qubits and quantum operations, ultimately improving their performance. AI can also assist in analysing and extracting insights from the extensive data generated by quantum experiments, refining quantum models, and aiding in decision-making processes; optimising error correction codes to mitigate errors in quantum systems, improving the reliability of quantum computations; and optimising the design and operation of quantum hardware, enhancing its performance and efficiency.  Quantum computing to enhance AI Quantum computing promises to significantly enhance the capabilities and accuracy of AI, unlocking the next generation of AI and machine learning models. For instance, it can accelerate classical machine learning algorithms, enabling the processing of larger data sets faster. Quantum computing can also enable the development of new machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for quantum data and quantum systems.  What challenges does AI bring to the field of quantum computing? As quantum computers advance, there is a potential risk of combining quantum computing and AI capabilities to enhance attacks on cryptographic systems and compromise the security of sensitive data protected by these algorithms. Adversarial attacks against AI-powered systems pose another threat, where manipulation of data or algorithms can deceive or exploit quantum AI systems, leading to erroneous or malicious outcomes. The collection and use of large datasets for AI algorithms in quantum computing raise concerns regarding data privacy and the potential misuse or unauthorised access to sensitive quantum data. The integration of AI and quantum computing may be hindered by compatibility issues between the different hardware and software platforms, requiring the development of standards and protocols for interoperability. Today’s computing systems, although having significantly improved decade after decade, can only solve problems up to a certain size and complexity. More complex issues require advanced computational power, and quantum computing promises to deliver such power. About quantum computing Classical computers rely on individual bits to store and process information as binary 0 and 1 states. Quantum computers rely on quantum bits – qubits – to process information; in doing so, they use two key quantum mechanical properties: superposition and entanglement. Superposition is the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time. Qubits still use the binary 0 and 1 system, but the superposition property allows them to represent a 0, a 1, or both at the same time. Instead of analysing 0s and 1s sequence by sequence, two qubits in superposition can represent four scenarios at the same time, thus reducing the time needed to process a data set.  Entanglement is a strong correlation between quantum particles, allowing them to be inextricably linked in perfect unison, even if separated by great distances. When two qubits are entangled, there is a special connection between them: If the individual qubits are measured, the outcome of the measurements could be 0 or 1; but the outcome of the measurement on one qubit will always be correlated to the measurement on the other qubit. And this is always the case, even if the particles are separated from each other by a large distance. In essence, superposition allows quantum computers to solve some problems exponentially faster than classical computers, while entanglement makes quantum computers significantly more powerful. Qubits can be created through different methods, such as using superconductivity to create and maintain a quantum state.",16.35,https://open.spotify.com/episode/6WmccqWGrB4AJR1IzYNWGa,['vi'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['liver'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-10-30

Cynthia Brix organized five international conferences to facilitate dialogue, interspiritual practice, and collaboration across the major religions and science. Will is author of Divine Duality: The Power of Reconciliation Between Women and Men (Hohm Press, 2007), and Belonging to God: Spirituality, Science, and a Universal Path of Divine Love (SkyLight Paths, Turner Publishing, 2016) and many more.  William is fascinating, and I highly recommend that you check out his work.  We talk about the following and so much more:  ✅   Some of the invisible patterns and principles that organize what we observe and experience in the physical world  ✅  How quantum physics plays into the world of spirituality and mysticism  ✅  Why  the work of physiscist David Bohm is so important - and why he studied his work for so long ✅ Some of the major conclusions that Einstein missed ✅ What it means to be in a “holotropic universe”? ✅ Desmond Tutu’s endorsement of his organization GERI - and why he and Cynthia decided to create the GERI?

I always thought it would be using computers for other things. So, I studied marine biology, geology, and computer science.  In this episode of Moore’s Lobby, we get to hear from one of the tech gurus at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on topics that include artificial intelligence; machine learning; portable, ruggedized, high-density storage; quantum computing; and explosions. Yes, explosions! Other fun topics include a discussion of Bill’s view of the Metaverse. I won’t give it all away, but it is definitely more than AR/VR goggles and involves everyone’s favorite spy, 007. After you listen to Bill explain how he graphs out his time on his calendar, you will get  some insight into how he has forged such an amazing career. It might even get you to start graphing your own calendar and time usage!  And, be sure to listen to the end for a truly fascinating story about how Star Trek influenced the technology we use every day.

6rKkc7ekzSYCZK2ddrLMCL,Ep360 - Michio Kaku | Quantum Supremacy,2023-07-04," Physicist and author Michio Kaku visits Google to discuss his book “Quantum Supremacy: How the Quantum Computer Revolution Will Change Everything.” The book takes us on an exhilarating tour of humanity’s next great technological achievement—quantum computing.  The runaway success of the microchip processor may be reaching its end. Running up against the physical constraints of smaller and smaller sizes, traditional silicon chips are not likely to prove useful in solving humanity’s greatest challenges, from climate change to global starvation and incurable diseases. But the quantum computer, which harnesses the power and complexity of the atomic realm, already promises to be every bit as revolutionary as the transistor and microchip once were. Its unprecedented gains in computing power herald advancements that could change every aspect of our daily lives.  Automotive companies, medical researchers, and consulting firms are betting on quantum computing, hoping to exploit its power to design more efficient vehicles, create life-saving new drugs, and streamline industries to revolutionize the economy. But this is only the beginning. Quantum computers could allow us to finally create nuclear fusion reactors that create clean, renewable energy without radioactive waste or threats of meltdown. They could help us crack the biological processes that generate natural, cheap fertilizer and enable us to feed the world’s growing populations. And they could unravel the fiendishly difficult protein folding that lies at the heart of previously incurable diseases like Alzheimer’s, ALS, and Parkinson’s, helping us to live longer, healthier lives. Told with Michio Kaku’s signature clarity and enthusiasm, “Quantum Supremacy” is the story of this exciting frontier and the race to claim humanity’s future.

The main theme explored is the connection between energy and manifesting dreams.  Suzanne shares what she believes to be true about the Quantum Field. She emphasizes the importance of understanding the power of frequency and vibrations in turning dreams into reality. She shares personal experiences, including a vivid childhood daydream of a magical “button house” where each button represented a unique dream. She shares an analogy of how you can plug into the Quantum Field of infinite possibilities through visualizing your own button house.  She talks about how external influences and societal expectations made her suppress her imagination and energetic power. Suzanne emphasizes the significance of alignment, which she describes as connecting with one's soul's purpose and passions, leading to the manifestation of authentic power. By tapping into the quantum field, a realm of infinite possibilities, one can attract desires with ease and let go of the need for control. Last but not least, Suzanne shares examples of individuals who experienced transformative shifts by connecting with the quantum field and aligning their energy with their dreams.  She mentions a profound encounter with a shamanic astrologer in Sedona, Arizona just above a Sedona Vortex and a reiki healer, both of whom played a role in shaping her understanding of her own purpose and potential. She encourages us to explore the question of what we would do if we had no limits and invites us to visualize our dreams and feel the emotional and physical sensations that come with them. She concludes by sharing an opportunity to join her Adams Actualization Activation workshop, which offers a transformative manifesting model to build upon the concepts discussed in the episode.

4siA7wwkEHU7Vb77Ij2fr3,"Quantum Queries — Dr. Florian Neukart, Principle Scientist at Volkswagen — Quantum Computing for Research and Simulation, the Pathway to Understanding Materials and Building Better Products",2019-01-16,"Dr. Florian Neukart, principle scientist at Volkswagen, delivers a comprehensive analysis of quantum computing and simulation utilized for research.  As principal scientist at Volkswagen Group, Dr. Neukart, focuses on intensive research in the fields of quantum computing, quantum machine learning, artificial intelligence, as well as materials science. He is a skilled computer scientist, mathematician, and noted scientific author. His particular study in the area of reverse-engineering the mind by systematically replacing the biological brain with manufactured components, such as quantum nanobots, electrodes, etc. has drawn a lot of interest in the scientific community.   Dr. Neukart discusses quantum systems and their extensive research utilizing quantum systems for simulation. By simulating molecules and atoms, Dr. Neukart hopes to gain a better understanding of materials’ properties, which could prove very useful for battery materials, regarding cathode and anode. Traditional, non-quantum, simulations leave a lot to be desired, and Dr. Neukart is excited about the accuracy in simulation that can be provided via quantum computers. He details the specifics of algorithms and artificial neural networks in relation to quantum computers with the goal of developing algorithms that are more accurate, and learn faster.  The quantum computing scientist details the movement of specific atoms and electrons, and the process during simulation of working with nuclei to better understand the energy surface of the molecule, to learn more about materials’ properties. Dr. Neukart explains how they use machine learning in their study, and the specifics of training models with quantum chips, to eventually be used in products. Dr. Neukart outlines the types of quantum computers they use in their research and how they work, as well as the potential difficulties each may present.   Dr. Neukart discusses the third area of interest in their research, beyond materials simulation and machine learning, and that is optimization. He discusses optimization in terms of traffic mobility, citing specifics with transportation services such as taxis, subway, buses, etc. He explains how optimization models can reduce wait times for passengers and increase productivity and efficiency. And this is an area where quantum computing can truly accelerate innovation.  Dr. Neukart earned his Ph.D. in quantum computing and artificial intelligence from the Transilvania University of Brasov, and a master's degree in information technology from the CAMPUS 02 University of Applied Sciences in Graz. Additionally, Neukart holds a master's degree in computer science from the Joanneum University of Applied Sciences in Kapfenbergn. ",32.38,https://open.spotify.com/episode/4siA7wwkEHU7Vb77Ij2fr3,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['liver'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2019-01-16

We don’t yet know the final answer, but the journey has taken us to some amazing places. A leader in this quest has been Leonard Susskind, who has helped illuminate some of the most mind-blowing ideas in quantum gravity: the holographic principle, the string theory landscape, black-hole complementarity, and others. He has also become celebrated as a writer, speaker, and expositor of mind-blowing ideas. We talk about black holes, quantum mechanics, and the most exciting new directions in quantum gravity. Support Mindscape on Patreon or Paypal. Leonard Susskind received his Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University. He is currently the Felix Bloch Professor of Physics at Stanford University. He has made important contributions to numerous ideas in theoretical physics, including string theory, lattice gauge theory, dynamical symmetry breaking, the holographic principle, black hole complementarity, matrix theory, the cosmological multiverse, and quantum information. He is the author of several books, including a series of pedagogical physics texts called The Theoretical Minimum. Among his numerous awards are the J.J. Sakurai Prize and the Oskar Klein Medal.

We talk about what a quantum computer is and promising technologies for actually building them. John emphasizes that quantum computers are tailor-made for simulating the behavior of quantum systems like molecules and materials; whether they will lead to breakthroughs in cryptography or optimization problems is less clear. Then we relate the idea of quantum information back to gravity and the emergence of spacetime.

For this Future Here podcast episode, I had the opportunity to interview Mikael Johansson, the Manager of Quantum Technologies at CSC - IT Center for Science in Finland. Quantum computers can in theory perform certain operations and complete tasks far faster than traditional computers, but they are still a long way from reaching their full potential.  While a traditional computer uses binary bits to perform all its calculations, quantum computers use qubits that can be a zero, a one, or both at the same time.  It’s definitely a lot to wrap your head around, but Mikael does a great job of describing how this actually works - both in theory and practice. Mikael works at CSC on the research and development of a 5-qubit quantum computer called HELMI. If you happened to listen to the first Future Here podcast episode, you might already know that last winter HELMI was connected with Europe’s fastest traditional supercomputer called LUMI. Together these instruments create the world’s most powerful computational device.

1xs1HL76Jm8YIO3e4V8iDl,2 - Quantum Computing Has A Purpose! (The Factoring Algorithm),2021-05-05,"In the mid-90’s, there was no quantum computing field. There was excitement, sure, but nearly a decade and a half after the conference at MIT Endicott House, the possibilities of marrying physics and computer science had yet to yield a significant technological breakthrough. That is, until Peter Shor discovered a way to break RSA, the most famous public-key cryptosystem. Shor’s Algorithm was more than a call to action for a generation of scientists, it was a glimpse of how much faster a quantum machine would be able to crack even the most complex encryption scheme. Sebastian, Abe and Matt sit down with Peter Shor to discuss the discovery of the algorithm, the extraordinary response his work received twenty-five years ago, and what’s next for ensuing generations of scientists and information theorists.

We are inventing dumb AI to supplement human interaction. Are there simple forms of artificial intelligence, simple programming of bots, such that when they are added to groups of humans – because those humans are smart or otherwise positively inclined - that help the humans to help themselves? Can we get groups of people to work better together, for instance, to confront climate change, or to reduce racism online, or to foster innovation within firms?Can we have simple forms of AI that are added into our midst that make us work better together? And the work we're doing in that part of my lab shows that abundantly that's the case.

You start with a photon, which has absolute freedom, but then once you move “into the realm of molecules and of organisms, then the amount of freedom is less.” However, following Arthur Young’s “reflexive arc,” freedom is regained in man. “But then even the mind becomes determined, as the ego does, and there has to be a consciousness beyond the ego that can observe and use the ego as a basis to transcend.” So we must now make a quantum—or evolutionary—leap “to go beyond biology.

2V699n9HPMOWbltRW4JqUx,"Quantum Questions – Murray Thom, Director of Software and Cloud Services at D-Wave Systems – How Quantum Computing Holds the Potential To Provide Answers To Many of the World’s Complex Problems",2018-12-19,"Murray Thom, director of software and cloud services at D-Wave Systems, The Quantum Computing Company (dwavesys.com), delivers a thorough overview of quantum computing and its many uses.  Thom is a seasoned professional in the technology and computing arena. He is heavily involved in multiple areas that are key to D-Wave’s operations, and success. Thom plays an instrumental role in the R&D at D-Wave, including design and manufacture of crucial components and elements. Additionally he provides important technical support to the sales team that relates to his in-depth knowledge of applications, algorithms, and more.  D-Wave Systems is the first quantum computing company and they are continually striving to make rapid advancements in the computing space. Notably, D-Wave recently released its 1000+ qubit D-Wave 2X system. And the impressive system was installed at the NASA/Google Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Lockheed Martin. The dramatic results from Google on the D-Wave 2X showed a 100,000,000 times speed increase over a traditional system for specific types of problems.  Thom talks about D-Wave’s mission: to unlock the power of quantum computers for real world solutions. He states that for nearly 20 years the company has been building quantum computers and servicing the clients, users, and developers who need them. Thom discusses some of their collaborative work with clients and customers over the past decade that has led to great advances and early applications for their quantum computing systems. He details some of their specific client projects, such as their work with Volkswagen on traffic flow optimization.  D-Wave’s quantum computer utilizes quantum dynamics to accelerate and create innovative methods for solving optimization, material science, sampling, and machine learning problems and issues. Through a process known as ‘quantum annealing’ it stimulates the tendency of real-world quantum systems to access new low-energy states. To consider optimization in terms of high and low points within a landscape, every coordinate represents a potential solution and the elevation represents its energy. And the optimum solution is the one with the lowest energy that corresponds to the lowest point across the landscape.  Thom outlines how quantum computers are different. A traditional computer stores information as ‘bits’ with assigned values of either 1 or 0. A quantum computer works with information that is preserved in quantum bits, known simply as qubits. And a qubit can hold a value of 1 or 0, essentially any quantum superposition of these two represented states. This is how quantum computers can process enormous volumes of information so easily. Quantum memory has incredibly impressive capacity. Though it seems small, it can store a tremendous amount of information, which enables users to search massive solution areas and find answers fast. Thom details D-Wave’s exciting project known as Leap, which is an environment for developers to literally build and operate their own specific quantum applications. Leap is cloud-based, and as such it provides real-time access to an operational quantum computer. Developers and researchers are provided the opportunity to work with open-source tools, and are given access to interactive demos, coding examples, and detailed information articles. Leap provides an open pathway to incredible collaboration within the active online community.  Thom cites specific examples of how quantum computing solutions impact advertising buys and budgets, and overall optimization, and the decision-making process of business leaders with respect to their advertising and marketing. From providing hotel recommendations to travelers, to optimization of workflow in factories, Thom discusses the numerous ways that quantum computing is changing how businesses operate.  Conventional systems are inept in many ways and quantum computing is stepping up to provide more advanced problem-solving assistance. Quantum computing provides the potential to solve many complex and extremely technical, scientific, defense, and commercial problems and Thom expects that it will deliver results in a myriad of industries and areas.",38.53,https://open.spotify.com/episode/2V699n9HPMOWbltRW4JqUx,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['liver'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2018-12-19

0Wck59ubTzZnamHcy5RWeW,ADAM ALTER - Author of Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology - Anatomy of a Breakthrough,2023-10-27,"Adam Alter is a Professor of Marketing at NYU’s Stern School of Business and the Robert Stansky Teaching Excellence Faculty Fellow. Adam is the New York Times bestselling author of Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked, and Drunk Tank Pink, which investigates how hidden forces in the world around us shape our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. He has written for the New York Times, New Yorker, The Atlantic, Washington Post, and a host of TV, radio, and publications. His next book Anatomy of a Breakthrough will be published in 2023. ""So there are different parts of the brain responsible for liking and wanting. So wanting is unbelievably robust in the brain. In other words, the neural connections are very robust, and wanting is what drives most addictive behavior. It's when you really want something, like you want a cigarette, you want alcohol, a drug, whatever it is, that's your poison. And actually, screens for some people as well. The liking part. When you say to people, what does it mean to be addicted to something? A lot of people say it's, 'You really like it so much that you just keep going back to it.'It's actually not about liking. What actually happens is that, in the beginning, liking and wanting go together. So let's pick something like a cigarette. If you start smoking in the beginning, you like the experience of smoking, and you also really want the nicotine. You want the cigarette. They go hand in hand, but eventually what happens is the liking is much more fragile, and it decays. And what's left is the wanting. And often in the absence of liking, it's kind of like a bad relationship. Like if you're in a bad romantic relationship, it starts out being about wanting and liking, but then the liking goes away, and you just kind of want to be with a person, even though you know it's undermining your welfare. That's effectively addiction.

4qGPAlfpIVaKRv8JFv0w8k,Highlights - ADAM ALTER - Author of Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology - Professor NYU’s Stern School of Business,2023-10-27," ""So there are different parts of the brain responsible for liking and wanting. So wanting is unbelievably robust in the brain. In other words, the neural connections are very robust, and wanting is what drives most addictive behavior. It's when you really want something, like you want a cigarette, you want alcohol, a drug, whatever it is, that's your poison. And actually, screens for some people as well. The liking part. When you say to people, what does it mean to be addicted to something? A lot of people say it's, 'You really like it so much that you just keep going back to it.'It's actually not about liking. What actually happens is that, in the beginning, liking and wanting go together. So let's pick something like a cigarette. If you start smoking in the beginning, you like the experience of smoking, and you also really want the nicotine. You want the cigarette. They go hand in hand, but eventually what happens is the liking is much more fragile, and it decays. And what's left is the wanting. And often in the absence of liking, it's kind of like a bad relationship. Like if you're in a bad romantic relationship, it starts out being about wanting and liking, but then the liking goes away, and you just kind of want to be with a person, even though you know it's undermining your welfare. That's effectively addiction. The real skill today is figuring out how to create space between you and your tech devices.""Adam Alter is a Professor of Marketing at NYU’s Stern School of Business and the Robert Stansky Teaching Excellence Faculty Fellow.

1T54Zga76aL3A57DsEs2mk,What is quantum physics...really? with Dr. Jed Buchwald,2022-11-02,"By now you're probably aware there's a new Ant-Man movie on the way in the Marvel Cinematic Universe called Quantumania. In the MCU and other science fiction media, the word ""quantum"" gets thrown around quite a bit.   Why can you teleport? Quantum physics. Why can you shrink to the size of an atom? Quantum mechanics. Why can you walk through walls or travel the multiverse or bring someone back from the dead? Quantum entanglement. Quantum computing. Quantum. Quantum. Quantum.   At this point the word ""quantum"" paired with just about any other word is a stand-in for something like ""science magic"". It's the label slapped on a bit of plot to explain why the protagonist can do the thing. But this type of slapdash explanation isn't relegated to the silver screen.   Films like 'What the BLEEP do we know?' and books like 'The Secret' all maintain that our thoughts affect the world around us. The phrase ""thoughts are things"" gets bandied about. Oftentimes this is called the ""Law of Attraction"", or whatever you think about most often tends to show up in your life. These days other buzzwords float around and occupy similar space. Affirmations. Manifestation. And why does any of this work? Quantum physics. Quantum mechanics. Quantum entanglement. Quantum. Quantum. Quantum.   I'm no physicist, but I know enough about marketing to know that the same word cannot possibly mean all of these things at the same time. Or could it? I'm no physicist after all. Perhaps it can? I wanted to ask an expert.   Jed Buchwald studied physics and science history at Princeton University, and earned a PhD from Harvard in 1974. He taught at the University of Toronto for two decades, where he spent a year as the director of that university's Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology. Buchwald then became the director of the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology and the Bern Dibner Professor of the History of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before joining Caltech in 2001. He has authored or co-authored six books in the history of science and, more recently, on the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics. He edits or co-edits three book series for Springer, one for MIT, and two journals. Buchwald is a member of the American Philosophical Society, a member of the International Academy of the History of Science, and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was also a MacArthur Fellow (1995) and a Killam Fellow (1990–1991).

4S4HtUvlaMwD4dvchDkuPP,Quantum: Why We Want 'Em,2018-02-19,"ENCORE Einstein thought that quantum mechanics might be the end of physics, and most scientists felt sure it would never be useful. Today, everything from cell phones to LED lighting is completely dependent on the weird behavior described by quantum mechanics. But the story continues. Quantum computers may be millions of times faster than your laptop, and applying them to big data could be transformational for biology and health. Quantum entanglement – “spooky” action at a distance – may not allow faster-than-light communication, but could be important in other ways. And there’s even the suggestion that quantum mechanics defines the difference between life and death. Quantum physics. It’s weird and exotic. But it’s how the universe works.

6LvGaURho8KCP5IfGbCowb,A mind-bending conversation about quantum mechanics and parallel worlds,2020-05-14,"While you read these words, the universe is splitting into countless copies. New realities, all with a version of you, exactly like you are now, but journeying off into their own branch of the multiverse. Maybe. Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at CalTech, the host of the Mindscape podcast, and author of, among other books, Something Deeply Hidden, which blew my mind a bit. He is also a believer in, and defender of, the “many-worlds” interpretation of quantum mechanics, which has to be one of the five most fun things in the world to think about. Science! This is a conversation where I get to do something I’ve always wanted to do: Ask a real quantum physicist all of my questions about quantum physics. And then ask again, when I don’t understand the answer, which I usually don’t. And then again, when I sort of understand, but there’s still a part tripping me up. Carroll is wonderfully patient and beautifully clear, and the result is a conversation I haven’t stopped telling friends about since I had it. This world sucks right now.

6hM2rbs6EYI8BZeJxMzeLQ,36 | David Albert on Quantum Measurement and the Problems with Many-Worlds,2019-03-04,"Quantum mechanics is our best theory of how reality works at a fundamental level, yet physicists still can’t agree on what the theory actually says. At the heart of the puzzle is the “measurement problem”: what actually happens when we observe a quantum system, and why do we apparently need separate rules when it happens? David Albert is one of the leading figures in the foundations of quantum mechanics today, and we discuss the measurement problem and why it’s so puzzling. Then we dive into the Many-Worlds version of quantum mechanics, which is my favorite (as I explain in my forthcoming book  Something Deeply Hidden). It is not David’s favorite, so he presents the case as to why you should be skeptical of Many-Worlds. (The philosophically respectable case, that is, not a vague unease at all those other universes.) Support Mindscape on Patreon or Paypal. David Albert received his Ph.D. in physics from Rockefeller University. He is currently the Frederick E. Woodbridge Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University. His research involves a number of topics within the foundations of physics, including the arrow of time (coining the phrase “Past Hypothesis” for the low-entropy state of the early universe) and quantum mechanics. He is the author of a number of books, including Time and Chance,  Quantum Mechanics and Experience, and  After Physics.

For this season, Tai-Danae and Adam will be focusing on a single topic: What is actually happening inside a quantum computer? By the end of this season, you'll have a better understanding of the ""how"" of quantum computing. So get ready to go beyond the theory and dig into what's actually going on these machines that harness the fundamental forces of the universe! In this second episode, we dig into DiVincenzo's first criterion for functional quantum computers: ""A scalable physical system with well-characterized qubits"". What does that mean? And do trapped ion quantum computers pass that test? And by the way, what's a trapped ion!? Learn about all of that and more...including a little something about Pringles! Want to get in touch?

5Qx3KV2rQV1I160fLoypYz,#34 - De toekomst is quantum,2017-07-27,"Mede mogelijk gemaakt door: DELLJulia Cramer (dr. ir.) promoveerde bij QuTech, het quantuminstituut van de TU Delft en TNO. Hier wordt onderzoek gedaan naar de technologie van de toekomst: de quantumcomputer en het quantum-internet. Nu werkt ze bij QuTech als outreach coördinator. Ook doet ze als postdoc onderzoek naar wetenschapscommunicatie in Leiden.  In deze aflevering van De Technoloog vertelt ze over de fundamenten van quantum. Natuurlijk komt Einstein langs, die in een crisis belandde door het idee van quantum. Wiskundige berekeningen bleken bizarre uitkomsten te hebben: deeltjes die op twee plekken tegelijk voorkwamen, verbindingen die afstand-onafhankelijk zijn - ze konden het niet observeren. Dankzij de technologische vooruitgang kan dat nu wel.   In Delft werken ze met hele kleine deeltjes, hele lage energie en enorm lage temperaturen (bijna absoluut nul) om quantum-effecten te kunnen waarnemen en ook te kunnen manipuleren.  Julia gaat in op de mogelijke toepassingen van quantumcomputers en beantwoordt vragen als: wanneer staat er zon computer op ons bureau.

These are just a few of the topics discussed by William Hurley, CEO of Strange works, which is a company that launched earlier this year during a South by Southwest Keynote presentation and raised $4 million just in seed money.   The main goal of the company is to make quantum computing technology more understandable to the layperson and more accessible to developers. Right now, the Strangeworks platform offers developers and enterprises a way to become familiar with the technology by performing quantum experiments, as well as a timeline of the likely advances in this technology. Hurley believes that within 24 to 36 months, quantum computing will be usable and produce real enterprise outcomes.  Quantum computing has come a long way in the past few years, but it has a ways to go. Among many other topics, Hurley discusses what he believes to be the two main factors holding back quantum computing: high cost and the unsolved problem of error correction.

And the past that doesn't exist...,2023-02-22,"So... what are your thoughts on this?   Right now is just one of thousands and thousands and thousands of universes...   Sounds a bit weird, right?    Different universes, different timelines... different possibilities...   What if you had turned right this morning instead of left?  What if you had gone out last night instead of staying in?  What if....?   All of these what-if options were other timelines you could have chosen.    But what does that have to do with quantum jumping?   Well... what if you could choose to jump into a different timeline?   What if you can choose to be that person in a different timeline?   So many possibilities.    Now... here is something for you to contemplate for a moment...   The past doesn't exist in this present moment.   The Chris 2 minutes ago isn't the Chris typing this now.  I'm a different Chris... 2 minutes older and I took the timeline that involved writing this rather than answering a phone call...   The old Chris is now a perception... a memory. That's all he is.   And you know what?   We'd all perceive that old Chris in different ways... we'd all have a different perspective of him... a different memory.    We are now in the present, which is a reference point of memories all compiled together to make us who we are.   So... taking into consideration that we've chosen to base ourselves on that past timeline of memories... isn't it possible that we can then choose to change?   What if we chose not to let those past memories dictate who we are now?    What if we choose to be someone different?     Today's session is a CRAZY one... but good crazy...

Wyjaśniony na monetach - Piotr Biskupski (IBM) EM #143,2023-04-26,"Jeszcze kilka lat temu powiedzielibyśmy: Pan raczy żartować panie Feynman! A dziś rozmawiamy jak w technologii wyszliśmy poza zera i jedynki. Musimy, kurde, używać komputera kwantowego.  Przygotujmy się na rewolucję, czyli ogromny przeskok, który pozwoli uzyskać przewagę kwantową. Nie chodzi o wykopanie wszystkich bitkojnów w kilka chwil. Quantum zastosujemy w branży auto-moto, przemyśle, analizie danych i fintechu, czy logistyce. Współpraca jest w projektach klasy enterprise, ale to tylko na chwilę. Już teraz można korzystać z kwantowej mocy, w dużej części za darmo. W Poznaniu mamy centrum innowacji kwantowych, które współpracuje bezpośrednio z IBM i umożliwia pracę nad kwantowymi problemami.    Czym właściwie jest Quantum Computing. Co się dzieje, gdy wychodzimy poza zera i jedynki w informatyce. Nasz gość wyjaśnia fenomeny kwantowe na monetach, kubkach, lodówkach oraz kotach (tych w pudełku).   Czapki z głów dla IBM za współpracę z uniwersytetami, tworzenie poptechowych treści i dzielenie się wiedzą w ramach kwantowej sieci.

To celebrate, we're going to have more than the usual number of podcasts about quantum mechanics over the next couple of months. Today is an experimental flipped podcast, in which I'm being interviewed by Rob Reid. Rob is the host of the After On podcast, of which this is also an episode. We talk about quantum mechanics generally and my favorite Many-Worlds approach in particular, homing in on the motivation for believing in all those worlds and the potential puzzles that this perspective raises.Support Mindscape on Patreon.Rob Reid received his MBA from Harvard. He currently works as an author, entrepreneur, and podcaster. He was the founder of Listen.com, which was acquired in 2003 by RealNetworks. He has written nonfiction books about Harvard Business School and about the early days of the Web, as well as two novels.

Topics include business agility and Teal, what it means to be an ethical engineer, bringing your whole self to work, highlights from QCon and InfoQ during 2019, the rise of Python, and progress in quantum computing.  Why listen to this podcast:  * Business agility is one of the major themes that the InfoQ team has seen emerge this year, with stronger emphasis on outcomes over outputs. We’ve also seen a growing interest in ethics and the ethical implications of the work we all do. * On the programming languages front the rise of Python continues, driven largely by its popularity in data science. * As Kubernetes cements its dominant position we’re hoping to see a simplification of the workflows associated with it, as well as in areas like observability. * There have been several big announcements in quantum computing in the past year, and this is an area we continue to watch with interest. * Another key trend for next year is edge computing. The edge of the cloud infrastructure has an amazing amount of available compute resource, as does the device edge.

4E5hvz3yQtpXzkCNLR4ARM,59 | Adam Becker on the Curious History of Quantum Mechanics,2019-08-12,"There are many mysteries surrounding quantum mechanics. To me, the biggest mysteries are why physicists haven’t yet agreed on a complete understanding of the theory, and even more why they mostly seem content not to try. This puzzling attitude has historical roots that go back to the Bohr-Einstein debates. Adam Becker, in his book What Is Real?, looks at this history, and discusses how physicists have shied away from the foundations of quantum mechanics in the subsequent years. We discuss why this has been the case, and talk about some of the stubborn iconoclasts who insisted on thinking about it anyway.Support Mindscape on Patreon.Adam Becker received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Michigan. He is currently a science writer and a Visiting Scholar at the Center for Science, Technology, Medicine & Society at UC Berkeley. His book What Is Real?

7A5USGBKBQEFxDBVb7jb7t,63 | Solo -- Finding Gravity Within Quantum Mechanics,2019-09-09,"I suspect most loyal Mindscape listeners have been exposed to the fact that I’ve written a new book, Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime. As I release this episode on Monday 9 September 2019, the book will officially be released tomorrow, in print, e-book, and audio versions. To get in the mood, we’ve had several podcast episodes on quantum mechanics, but the “emergence of spacetime” aspect has been neglected. So today we have a solo podcast in which I explain a bit about the challenges of quantum gravity, how Many-Worlds provides the best framework for thinking about quantum gravity, and how entanglement could be the key to showing how a curved spacetime could emerge from a quantum wave function. All of this stuff is extremely speculative, but I’m excited about the central theme that we shouldn’t be trying to “quantize gravity,” but instead looking for gravity within quantum mechanics.

4iO3WU9MpujOk647ZmjzYu,Could quantum computing change the world?,2019-04-07,"Once we believed that the world around us behaved according to the laws of classical mechanics, and it took us hundreds of years to work out that actually something else was going on. Quantum computing offers what we believe to be the best way to process information based on the laws of physics as we now know them. But how did we discover that quantum mechanics could offer such developments in computing? And why did this realm remain hidden for so long?   For this special episode of Futuremakers, Peter Millican, Professor of Philosophy, set out to discover the truth about a global race to develop the world’s first scalable quantum computer. He met a diverse range of researchers, who gave him their thoughts on the powerful next realm of computation their work opens up, via the fundamental building blocks, to the ultimate goal of a truly universal quantum computer. Keep listening to find out why there's a race to create this technology, if Oxford's researchers believe we'll ever achieve our goal, and what it could mean for society if we did.",46.86,https://open.spotify.com/episode/4iO3WU9MpujOk647ZmjzYu,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2019-04-07

I'm joined today by Dr. Sarah Kaiser, who is very recently a technical staff member and quantum community lead at Unitary Fund. Sarah, welcome to the show. Sarah: Hi, Corey. Thanks for having me. Corey: So there's a lot to unpack. Let's start with the easy stuff. What is Unitary Fund? Sarah: Yeah, so we're actually a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that is invested in trying to grow the quantum open-source software community. So, we kind of do two main things: we give out micro-grants to help support maintainers on projects, or other sorts of community groups or educational projects that kind of help grow the community of quantum developers; and we also do—given that we kind of spent a lot of time in the quantum open-source software space—we also have our own kind of internal development team and we work on building up software projects in gaps that we see that maybe are not as interesting or kind of boring, but actually are needed to overall help the ecosystem grow. Corey: So let's start I guess with a big, meaty topic: quantum computing. It feels like it's something that we've been hearing about for 20 years, usually in almost the same sense as we have cold fusion which is, a practical X is always 20 years away. And over time, recently, we've started seeing actual products and services come out from companies that are talking about exciting breakthroughs from a quantum perspective. But the challenge I've always had is, first, what is quantum computing? Every time I've tried to delve into it, it seems that, “Oh, just go through the ‘Hello World’ example.” And the challenge, of course, is that ‘Hello World’ in quantum computing is basically a PhD. Given that you already have one of those, help. What is it? Sarah: [laugh]. That's a great question. Honestly, the way I like to think about quantum computing, generally as a field, and in this case, in a literal product sense is, it's a hardware accelerator for computation. So, in the same way that we have, like, GPUs, and FPGAs that are bespoke, custom-designed hardware that can accelerate different—whether it's machine learning or graphics processing, quantum computers are—I kind of loathe that they are called computers; they really should just be called quantum hardware accelerators. [laugh]. Corey: Right. You start calling them computers, I start wondering, okay, and I scroll them and huh. They're not for sale at Best Buy. What's the deal here? Sarah: Exactly. You're not going to check your email; importantly, they're not going to replace all computers. Corey: Well, not with that attitude. Okay, not to sound cynical here, but I do look at some of these electronic stores and they're selling $200 audio cables because it's better than the $50 one, and it's passing nothing but digital signal anyway. So, if people will buy anything that's hyped well enough, I mean, there's certainly been enough hype poured into quantum computing to the point where, at least from where I said, it's occluding what it actually is and what it's capable of.  Sarah: Yeah. Think I’d entirely agree with that. I think what is important, as someone who has spent over 10 years of their life researching and working in this field, I still do think there still is really interesting and cool stuff here, it's just maybe not exactly the features or things that are hyped for venture capital funding. [laugh]. Corey: Yeah, part of the challenge with raising VC for something like quantum is that the immediate short term returns are hard to demonstrate. And I'm being very charitable with that. Not from a success or a breakthrough story, but from a position of economic viability. It seems that very often, one of the challenges with quantum computing and explaining what it is, is even articulating the type of problem that a quantum computer is built to solve. Is that a fair assessment? Or am I radically misunderstanding something? Probably both? Sarah: [laugh]. No, I think you're actually pretty spot-on there. One of the ways I like to think about it is, we have a pretty clear description or box that we can say, “These are the types of problems that say a GPU is good at. We know that any problem that's highly parallelizable, if we can make the solution to our problem fit in those sort of constraints, yep, throw it at a GPU. We're good.”  For quantum computing, where we're at is we basically have examples of things that might be in that box, like we know we can speed up this specific problem, we can speed up this specific problem, but we haven't really worked out what the generalization of—you know, the class of problems or the types of problems that we might be able to solve here. So, it makes it hard to say, “Well, yes. Here's your arbitrary problem.” I actually have to sit down and work through and try to figure out a specific solution to that problem, as opposed to being able to have a general framework, like parallelization or something like that, to break your problem down into something that I can use on the device. Corey: Please don't take this as the deadly insult that it probably comes across as, but it feels similar in some respects to machine learning, where there was a lot of excitement about it, but every time that someone tried to articulate the real-world business value, it was either aimed at an incredibly specific business use case that is only going to work within one or maybe two companies or alternately, it came across as completely ridiculous. The example that springs to mind for that is when WeWork, back when that was a thing, talked about using their machine learning algorithms to determine that there was congestion in their lobbies at certain times, so they wound up bringing in a second barista during that time window. And it's, “Let me get this straight. You spent how much on data science to figure out that people like to drink coffee in the morning? Yeah, have you ever talked to a barista and figured out maybe there's a pattern here that a human could discern way faster?” It feels like it either lends itself to mockery, or to extreme niche use cases. And I know that's wrong, but that is the impression a lot of folks are left with. Is quantum in the same boat? Sarah: So, I think actually, in some senses, we currently are, in that, kind of like I was saying, we don't really have a good way of generalizing what types of problems are suitable to speed-ups on our quantum devices. Because having a GPU, that doesn't mean it universally speeds up everything on my computer. If I'm I/O bound, or something like that, it doesn't help. Same with a quantum computer, I can have one—like, even if you literally gave me one today, descended from the heavens, it was perfect, error corrected. I honestly wouldn't know what to do with it [laugh] because we really haven't had a chance to try out larger applications.  But I don't—from my perspective, and maybe it's [laugh] just in that I've been doing research on this for a long time, but I think that doesn't necessarily preclude that there won't be. There are no no-go proofs that we won't be able to find other interesting things. And what I think, to me at, like, an almost romantic level, what is really beautiful about quantum computing is that it's an entirely different physical resource that we're actually using to do the computation. FPGAs, GPUs, they're all at some level the same sort of transistors on silicon [laugh] that at some level function the same-ish way. Maybe we put them together differently, but they're the same Legos.  Here, this is, now we got K’Nex. [laugh]. So, we haven't been thinking with K'Nex brains for a long time because we've been building with Legos, so it is kind of hard to actually find what maybe we can build with K'Nex. And that's what I'm really personally excited about exploring and using, honestly, the—we need to build up the hardware, of course, but that's where I actually see quantum software as being a really exciting kind of emerging discipline here, where we can actually start exploring K’Nex type solutions, [laugh] but all in software. Corey: That, on some level almost seems to lend itself to another comparison, which is something you happen to be renowned for. Specifically, whenever we look at the industry and what they're doing with AI and machine learning, people are starting to find actual use cases for it. And that's exciting, and that's great. And that use case is invariably some form of bias laundering, where I put my biases in, the algorithm does this thing—as if that somehow absolves me of all responsibility—and then it spits my own biases back to me. But now I'm considered to be somewhat blameless. The ethics of quantum computing feel like they're still far away as the actual underlying technology gets built out. But you've been talking about it a fair bit. Tell me more. Sarah: Yeah, machine learning is a really apt comparison, I think here because it is exactly a form of bias laundering. And as someone who's excited about technology, and always is excited about building it, I always try to keep in the forefront of my mind and in forefront of our discussions, there’s: can we do it? And then the other question is, should we do it? [laugh]. And so I think quantum computing is a technology that does have the possibility of drastically changing our society.  The computational power for at least the problems that we've seen speed-ups on is incredible. And so I have to really sit with myself and think about okay, this is great if I have it, or essentially, good people have it, but what could an adversary or what could a malicious agent do with this technology? And that's why I think it's really important to make sure, as we're building out this technology, this community, this field as a whole, that we really try to involve as many people as possible and get as many people as developers—literally full-stack quantum computing is kind of a thing now, [laugh] so we really need everybody at the table when we're making these decisions, so it doesn't just kind of turn into a bunch of white guys at a table making a choice for everyone.  Corey: Sorry, the other thing you just said about full-stack quantum computing is objectively terrifying on some level. It's one of those “Oh, great. You think boot camps are hard now because JavaScript doesn't make sense”—because it doesn't to me—“Great. Wait until we introduce the rest of this.” And it becomes almost this, I guess, surreal vision of a possible future. Do you believe that quantum computing is a technical inevitability? Sarah: I do. I think we will, eventually, it's going to be a long pull. Like I know even when I started grad school over 10 years ago, they told me it was 20 years away at that point. I think they still say it's 20 years away, as you said. I have no good idea about hardware timelines, but what I think is here and present, and actually we in the year of our Lord 2021, have a chance to actually influence and change how we're developing the stack around the hardware.  Like I said before, if someone showed up and gave us a working hardware device right now, we wouldn't have the networking, the classical, kind of, dispatch. And that's basically where we're trying to build up: how does quantum computing integrate with the rest of the stack? And honestly, really, the best model for it is [laugh] as a cloud-computing resource. So it's not going to be a device that you have in your house or you put into your gaming PC build, but it'll be a thing that is offered—and is currently offered, actually, from a lot of the major cloud vendors like AWS, and Azure, and whatnot. So, I think trying to figure out what that looks like from a consumer standpoint is a really exciting and really cool place to actually make a difference. Corey: Whenever I start looking into quantum computing and understanding the various approaches to it—I know AWS launched their Braket service last year, which was interesting in that it oh, it's finally contextualizing this through the lens of something that I spent a lot of time working with. And I pulled it up and, honestly, I don't know if you're familiar with a subreddit VXJunkies or not, but—and I'm telling a bit of a secret here, so I will deny this—fortunately it’s just you and me, and no one will ever listen to this—but the entire subreddit is built upon technobabble of explaining things back and forth that aren't actually real, and people making up technical words. And it's incredibly convincing; no one is entirely sure when they first discover this, whether it's real or not. And it was a remarkable parallel for looking at what these things were. The terminology behind quantum computing is unreal; the entire methodology by which these things get addressed, the concept of qubits, and different types of quantum computers that require different aspects, and some of them apparently are, I don't know, liquid-fueled or something like that.  At this point, it's one of these, is this just a giant attempt to have fun at my expense? Because, honestly, if so, yeah, one, good work. Why is it so radical a departure from the world that most of us are used to? Sarah: You highlight something that is kind of uniquely challenging about quantum computing, and I think it really comes from the fact that it is a really interdisciplinary field. At a minimum—you know, if you were to sit down and hire a bunch of people to, in a closed room, build a quantum computer, you'd probably need a chemist, you’d need electrical engineers, you’d need mechanical engineers, you’d need physicists, you’d need computer theorists, you’d need mathematicians. And something that I really struggled with through grad school is, like, almost every textbook or resource you look at is a view of quantum computing from that field.  Corey: All you're missing at that point is a bartender for the punchline. Sarah: Basically. [laugh]. But yeah, what you're seeing there is basically this amalgamation of jargon from four or five different distinct research areas and fields. And frankly, I feel like even the researchers in the fields—we name things ‘magic states,’ a lot of our analogies and papers are about King Arthur; it's like the Quantum Merlin Arthur problem. There's at least some fun had with the terminology, but also, yeah, it's kind of a mess. [laugh]. And so I've written a textbook, on teaching kind of quantum computing with Python and Q#, and one of the things I've tried really hard to do there is strip as much of that away as possible and use common language terms from programming to refer to what are effectively just names for particular types of matrices and stuff like that. Corey: The challenge, too, at least to my mind, is, every time I step through this, it talks about things like running a quantum shop, for example—which again, does not detract from the idea of having a bartender involved somewhere—but even the idea of doing something like that is bizarre to me because my problem is, I cannot, in layperson's terms, come up with a reasonable explanation for what kind of problem would I have that this would solve? And I'm not even asking for a real business problem. That still feels like it's years away. I'm talking about things like, “Well, all right. You're going to learn to write code. So, all right, we're going to make the program spit out ‘Hello, world.’” “Cool, I can do that.” “Now we're going to make the thing count from one to 10.” “Awesome. Yay. I'm programming.” And honestly, you are at that point. Sure it's at an elementary level, but that is fundamentally what it's about. A lot of things I've looked at, even their basic ‘Hello World’ equivalents are tremendously confusing. Is that just something I'm missing? Sarah: I don't think there's something exactly that you're missing there. What I think has been happening is a lot of the software and tools that we're developing for quantum computing right now is pretty heavily focused on bootstrapping up those initial quantum devices that folks are building right now. So, we have some number of qubits that you can access from IBM, or IonQ, or Honeywell, or wherever, and most of the software that's getting written is really geared towards that. Which, it's kind of like trying to think about writing programs on your computer in machine code because that's literally—you're thinking about gates. The programs are often called circuits. Corey: Yeah, assembly is a good analogy here. It feels a lot like the assembly class I took half of once, and then immediately stopped attending because, “Wow, all right, my brain is full time for me to excuse myself.” You’re right, that feels very similar. Sarah: Yeah, I'm not a firmware person. I don't really like thinking at that level. I'm much more comfortable in Python, where I can just say, “Please give me a variable.” And I don't have to think about pointers, or memory management, or anything.  I'm really excited about building and thinking about what the tools for quantum computing look like at that level of abstraction. And so kind of the closest we have—there are some different programming languages that are kind of being targeted more at the algorithmic level like that, like Q# and stuff like that, some of the Python tools that are out there. And that's where I think is a much better place for people to start with quantum computing because then, I feel like that's more commensurate with what you would see with a Python or Rust or something like that ‘Hello World’ program, as opposed to, here’s all of the assembly instructions to say ‘Hello World’ on the screen.  Corey: This episode is sponsored in part byChaosSearch. As basically everyone knows, trying to do log analytics at scale with an ELK stack is expensive, unstable, time-sucking, demeaning, and just basically all-around horrible. So why are you still doing it—or even thinking about it—when there’s ChaosSearch? ChaosSearch is a fully managed scalable log analysis service that lets you add new workloads in minutes, and easily retain weeks, months, or years of data. With ChaosSearch you store, connect, and analyze and you’re done. The data lives and stays within your S3 buckets, which means no managing servers, no data movement, and you can save up to 80 percent versus running an ELK stack the old fashioned way. It’s why companies like Equifax, HubSpot, Klarna, Alert Logic, and many more have all turned to ChaosSearch. So if you’re tired of your ELK stacks falling over before it suffers, or of having your log analytics data retention squeezed by the cost, then try ChaosSearch today and tell them I sent you. To learn more, visitchaossearch.io. Corey: That's part of the challenge is that there needs to be at least some grounding at that level of technical competence. I would still argue as a result—and please feel free to contradict me on this one—that if people wind up coming at this without having some grasp of lower-level computing concepts and principles, they're likely to struggle. Is that a fair assessment? Sarah: Yeah, just like in classical computing, we have developers at every level in the stack: we have people who are working on literal CPU instruction optimization sort of things, all the way to doing web dev, and database, and cloud stuff. Right now, most of our tools in quantum computing, and honestly, most of the educational focus is all at that CPU assembly sort of level. And there yes, it is more necessary to kind of know more about the hardware, to know more about what the qubits are actually doing because you're literally interfacing with it. I think it's a lot easier to kind of start actually at a higher level. And it's kind of like if you want to learn a new Python package or something like that.  I don't usually sit down and read through the API docs. I will start with their just very high-level example, and then as I need to understand things as I use it, I will go and dive in. I think you can take a similar approach to quantum computing, where you say, “All right. I want to actually start at this really high level; let's talk about algorithms, let's talk about built-in functions sorts of things, and then drill down and understand, kind of, once you have that broader picture of what's going on.” I think it's, kind of like, rather than starting zoomed in on a map, on Google Maps at Street View to understand where you are in a city, it's much easier to maybe start zoomed out a lot farther. Corey: So, I opened this episode by joking about the tutorial being a PhD. That is clearly a bit above and beyond where we actually are in this day and age. But what are the realistic prerequisites? I've never been a fan of gatekeeping and I refuse to accept the answers, “You must have this degree from this university.” “Cool. Then you need to get out of my office,” because there's never just one path to anything.  And I understand that there are absolutely prerequisites that in many cases are hard to find without very specific academic achievements, credentials, and prerequisite, but I don't know that a PhD is one that I would even accept. So, what is the real-world limit of what you should know before diving into this space? Sarah: First of all, I really do think anyone can actually be a quantum technologist or be a quantum software dev, is really the most critical skill for working on this stuff is basically linear algebra. So, if you can multiply matrices on a computer with whatever programming language, you can already start building quantum software, basically. I actually went into quantum computing—so I was in a regular physics track in undergrad, and then I saw these triple integral crap, and then I was like, “Oh God, this is really hard. I don't want to memorize any of this.”  And then I saw quantum was like, it's just matrices. And I knew how to make my computer—I knew how to make Mathematica multiply those, so I didn't have to do it by hand. So, I really think there's a lot of misconceptions about, exactly as you say, gatekeeping, or you must be this smart to participate. I regularly now in the open-source community work with a ton of folks that have no background in quantum, they were actually a web front-end dev, and they're helping to make contributions to these quantum open-source projects and tools. So, my personal belief is anyone can be a quantum developer, and I would hope people take me up on that and take a look at some of these higher-level approaches. That really—linear algebra. A little bit of statistics is nice, but honestly, that's where having software is helpful because it'll just do that for you. You don't have to think about the details of exactly what's going on there. Corey: As someone who basically capped out at precalculus, to me, it sounds, oh, okay, this is not going to be accessible to me without a whole lot of study and planning. But the reason I bring that up is not for pity, or for you to, “Oh, no, it'll be fine,” then I go in, and it is very much not fine. But to point out that I believe this is like almost anything else in technology across the board which is today, it might be beyond my capability of easily getting into and assimilating, but the bar always gets lower, never higher. Things simplify over time.  It used to take three weeks to effectively get a web server up and running. Now, it requires basically a passing thought or a checkbox on a website. It gets easier with time. So, my question for you is, do you have a ballpark and very general ‘predict the future’ census of when this starts becoming more accessible to more people without the either math background or math focus? And I understand that's an incredibly loaded question. Sarah: Yeah, I straight up generally refused to answer the question of, “When are we going to have a quantum computer?” But I think about now how easy it is for me to use PiTorch or something like that to do machine learning sort of things. I can in one or two lines with a folder full of pictures of my dog, [laugh] get it to train on my dog. That's the kind of accessibility that I really hope—kind of as you were describing—that we can get to with quantum computing.  And I really do think that in probably the next five to ten years, we can get the software there. Whether we have hardware necessarily to back it or not, that is sufficiently large for what people want to do, I honestly have never worried about [laugh] and, frankly, don't care. [laugh]. They're working on it; they're engineering problems. They'll get there when they get there.  It took how long to get transistors from the giant triangles of lead down to what's sitting here in my [laugh] PC next to me. But the software and kind of like that user experience, or what does it mean to actually use this technology is somewhere that we can make huge strides in the next five to ten years to have an experience kind of analogous to checking a box or whatnot to add whatever it is, quantum machine learning or whatever, to your projects or whatnot. Corey: So, you send it you don't ever accept or answer the question of when are we going to have a quantum computer? And that's fair. But let me see if I can sort of do an end-run around that. What do we actually need in order to make quantum computers practical? And you can, of course, solve for ‘practical’ however you'd like. Sarah: [laugh]. Sure. So, where we're at right now is basically we have a bunch of different kind of competing types of technology. Like you were even talking about the [laugh] liquid-run ones that possibly you were meaning the ones that you have in a bath of liquid helium or nitrogen. But we have superconducting qubits, we have ion trapped qubits, we have optical qubits.  There's lots of different options. And basically, there's five criteria that we need to have for it to be a good scalable type of device. Each of those technologies usually meets three, no problem. Then there's one that's an engineering stretch, but we mostly got in hand. And then there's one that’s, like, kind of an open question.  And so basically, where it seems like we've landed is superconducting is probably, at least at the moment—superconducting and ion trap technologies are kind of the leading candidates. But mostly, we just need time. The nice thing that these devices that they're currently pursuing can leverage, is all of our experience building all of the silicon manufacturing infrastructure. Obviously, we're pretty good at that; that's all of classical computing. And so we can leverage that for miniaturization, and really what they're kind of iterating on right now is reducing noise. So, quantum devices, in general, to stay quantum have to be isolated from the environment, and so it's just working on progressively better isolation. Corey: Which sounds increasingly hard to do, given that we can't effectively handle isolation, even in a conceptual sense. When we look at things like oh, data security of, oops, did I accidentally turn the database backups into a web server with a wrong mouse click somewhere? If that sounds like getting stuff like that separated out, but still usable, is that as heavy a lift as it sounds like? Sarah: Yep, pretty much. [laugh]. And honestly, that is kind of one of the most interesting questions to me. Having done some research on it, quantum machine learning is the thing. We've found algorithms that can help us speed up certain machine learning tasks, but the problem is, any advantages we find at an algorithmic level there are entirely blown away once we use—basically load the data [laugh] load the data—like, transferring classical data into the quantum computer for it to operate on it. So, those sorts of protocols that people usually just, let's assume we have that. We need to fill in the homework, and we need to fill in those answers before we can figure out some more applications. Corey: At some level, it sounds unsatisfying, but the answer is, it's still a work in progress. I will say that it's interesting to see that even as early days as it is, you're still focused squarely on the ethics piece of it. Out of curiosity, is this something different than what we saw with the rise of things like machine learning, or were there folks early on in that process as well, talking about the ethics and thinking about the bigger philosophical questions? In other words, do we have a better chance now of avoiding some of the pitfalls that we keep smacking into as a society because we didn't pay enough attention the first time? Sarah: I would like to hope, but I honestly don't think we are learning fast enough. I mean, it is early days, but what I've, even in the course of my career, seen it shift strongly from being an only academic pursuit to now a very largely industrial, most everyone I know now works for companies [laugh] working on this stuff—they're not postdocs, they're not professors—and that gives me some hope because weirdly, in general, I think companies are better at being ethical than academic institutions, just because they have lawyers. [laugh]. But I want to hope that we can do better. But right now I don't think we're on a better track, honestly. Corey: Well, I have a serious problem ending an episode on that much of a downer, so let's ask one more question that expands on something a bit more hopeful. If folks have listened to this episode, and don't have the shrieking aversion, going back in time 20 years to struggling with math class in high school, or whatnot, and think I actually would like to get started with some of this, where would you recommend that they start? Sarah: Self-promotion-y, come chat with me on office hours. So, I stream a lot on Twitch, both just kind of working on quantum open-source projects, and I also do office hours where people can come just ask me whatever questions you have about quantum computing, or just, kind of, tech stuff in general, or crazy stories about what we blew up in the lab. [laugh]. There's lots of good resources, like myself, on Twitter, and to just, kind of like, actually interact with the people who are currently building this stuff. Because I think, at a personal level, we're probably different than who you might expect is actually working on the technology.  As I mentioned earlier, I also have a textbook—or it's not a textbook, really. It's more of, like a, kind of, PowerShell in a Month of Lunches sort of format. [laugh]. But it's called Learning Quantum Computing with Python and Q#. It is basically geared for your average sort of dev; helps if you know Python, but you don't strictly have to know Python, just any sort of programming experience is good.  There are tons of good open-source sorts of resources out there, there's good awesome lists, stuff like that. The main thing I will caution is, guard yourself against the hype. [laugh]. Kind of like how we opened the episode with. There is a lot of hype out there that we've solved time travel with quantum healing crystals, whatever. Bring your best rational sort of logical skills when, kind of, exploring some of that stuff, and you will gain the most. Corey: I think that is a much more uplifting vision for the future than a dark cloud over the future of humanity. But that seems to be the season for either one of those, now. People get to choose their own adventure on this one. If people want to learn more about what you're up to specifically, where can they find you? You've already mentioned your Twitch stream, but where else? Sarah: Yep, I'm on Twitter a lot. [laugh]. My handle there is crazy--the number 4-pi314 I did pi memorization contests in high school, so kind of was my first internet handle, and that's pretty much what I am everywhere on GitHub, on Twitter. You can also find more about what I'm doing on my website, sckaiser.com. Corey: And we will, of course, put links to that in the [00:32:43 show notes]. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. I appreciate it. Sarah: Yeah, this has been really fun. And I hope folks are interested to check out some quantum computing stuff, and come make fun of it on Twitter, too. [laugh]. Corey: Sounds good. Thank you once again for your time.

0dr3FAOY47CERO86IEV3zG,11. Il quantum computing,2020-07-03,"Il quantum computing - di Andrea Frollà, con Raffaele Mauro Cosa si nasconde davvero dietro la locuzione anglo-latina quantum computing? La corsa ai qubit sarà un affare esclusivo dei colossi hi-tech o ci sarà spazio pure per le startup? E ancora, che ruolo potrà giocare il nostro Paese in questo segmento tecnologico?

3j7uZuhk2Okx86OLsYbT4P,Ep 013: A Polymath PhD On The Quantum Biologic Connection To Everything,2023-03-02,"“A fundamental problem that people have is they've got enough energy to survive, but they can't thrive. And that's where I think quantum biology provides this enormous lens to allow people to tap into energy,” shares Sara Pugh, PhD. Dr. Sara is a polymath scientist turned quantum practitioner with a wealth of experience across many disciplines. She has experience in everything from pilates and functional neurology to close up magic and hypnosis. Today, host Meredith Oke talks with Dr. Sara Pugh about quantum biology and its connections to everything. Whether you’re looking at how hypnosis works, why people are able to be tricked by stage magic, or health concerns like heart rate variability and chronic pain, everything comes down to quantum biology and circadian rhythm. When the body does not have order, there is room for inflammation to take over. Often people think changing their diets is enough to fix their health. However, 60% of electrons come from non-food sources like sunlight, and without that trigger, the body is unable to create vital hormones. People need to spend more time regulating their circadian rhythm by connecting with nature, seeing the sunrise and sunset, and eating and sleeping at the correct times. These elements are key for enabling the mitochondria to generate enough structured water for the body to perform optimally. When you get down to it, everyone is connected through quantum biology. When circadian rhythm is out of order your mitochondria cannot create enough structured water and health problems begin to occur.  Quotes “When I've looked at people's heart rate variabilities, there tends to be lots of problems there because we don't sort of do basic things like going out and cuddling or stroking animals or being in nature and just feeling part of the universe.” (15:30-15:46 | Dr. Sara) “You can have all of the precursors in the world to make a neurotransmitter, but if there's not the trigger, like the sunlight, the serotonin isn't gonna get made.” (23:04-23:12 | Dr. Sara) “The blue light from the sun is our timekeeper, and a brain that can't tell the time is like a brain that doesn't know where it is. It's gonna be confused and stressed out.” (25:47-25:56 | Dr. Sara) “Inflammation is chaos, and the more order there is in the body, the better.” (26:23-26:27 | Dr. Sara) “We get 60% of our electrons from non-food sources.” (30:20-30:24 | Dr. Sara) “A fundamental problem that people have is they've got enough energy to survive, but they can't thrive. And that's where I think quantum biology provides this enormous lens to allow people to tap into energy.” (33:53-34:06 | Dr. Sara)  Links  To find a practitioner who understand the health principles of quantum biology: www.quantumbiologycollective.org  Join the QBC Practitioner Community: www.quantumhealthtv.com  Certification: www.appliedquantumbiology.com  Sara Pugh is @busysuperhuman on Instagram, TikTok & Facebook  Follow on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok  & Facebook: @quantumhealthtv    Podcast production and show notes provided by HiveCast.fm",76.45,https://open.spotify.com/episode/3j7uZuhk2Okx86OLsYbT4P,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-03-02

He is best known for contributions to quantum gravity as a co-inventor of loop quantum gravity and deformed special relativity. Beyond his work in other areas of physics, Lee has written a number of best-selling books, the most recent of which is Einstein’s Unfinished Revolution: The Search for What Lies Beyond the Quantum (Penguin, 2019). In this episode, Robinson and Lee discuss one of the main tenets that has characterized his work over the past decades: Realism. They first talk about realism in quantum mechanics before moving on to Lee’s version of radical presentism, in which only what is occurring in the immediate present can be said to exist, before finishing the main body of their conversation with mathematics and its relation to both physics and cosmology. The episode ends with brief digressions on biology and living with Parkinson’s disease. Lee is also an Honorary Fellow of the John Bell Institute for the Foundations of Physics.

If you could be literally any kind of being you chose to be, what kind of being would you want to be? What constraints and limitations and flaws would you want to retain because it's part of what makes you, you. And what aspects would you want to improve? If you have like a bad knee, you probably would want to fix the knee. If you're nearsighted, and you could just snap your fingers and have perfect eyesight, that seems pretty attractive, but then if you keep going in that direction, eventually, it's not clear that you're human anymore.

2Zo9XLIE076SVp7kL4a3iT,Brian Cox on quantum mechanics,2014-09-23,"Professor Brian Cox of Manchester University describes how he gave up appearing on Top of the Pops to study quarks, quasars and quantum mechanics.   Although he describes himself as a simple-minded Northern bloke, he has acquired an almost God-like status on our TV screens; while the 'Cox effect' is thought to explain the significant boost to university admissions to read physics. He talks to Jim Al-Khalili about learning to be famous, his passion for physics and how he sometimes has difficulty crossing the road.   In 2005 Brian was awarded a Royal Society Research Fellowship for his work on high energy particle collisions at CERN and elsewhere - an enviable academic achievement. In 2009, he was voted one of the sexiest men alive by People magazine. He has invented a new kind of celebrity - a scientist who's regularly snapped by the paparazzi.  Brian wants everyone to be as excited as he is about the laws that govern our universe: the beautiful, counter-intuitive and often weird world of quantum mechanics that explains what happens inside the nucleus of every atom, right down at the level of those exotically named elementary particles - quarks, neutrinos, gluons, muons.   Challenged by Jim to explain the rules of quantum mechanics in just a minute, Brian succeeds; while conceding that the idea that everything is inherently probabilistic, is challenging. Even Einstein found it difficult. Schrodinger's cat, or Brian Cox, for that matter, are simultaneously both dead and alive. That's a fact. What this is all means is another question. ""Am I just an algorithm?"" Brian asks. ""Probably"", says Jim.

312WSgmHfNbls37cBsYJRM,Ep 001 Why The Human Health Paradigm Is Shifting From Bio Chemical to Quantum Biologic,2022-12-15,"“The great news of quantum biology is that life gets better, and our health can get better,” explains host Meredith Oke. Welcome to The Quantum Biology Collective Podcast, where Meredith breaks down the practical health application of this emerging science. As we head towards a scientific revolution, Meredith uses today’s episode to explain the intersection between quantum physics and biology and how this topic relates to human health. As someone who has struggled with chronic fatigue for many years, Meredith went from doctor to doctor to find a solution. When traditional medicine failed her, she embarked on a quantum biology journey to discover more information about health and wellness. Although we can’t always fix our mitochondria and heal, subscribing to this science's principle will improve our overall health and quality of life. It’s getting much clearer why the human health paradigm is shifting. Learn more about Meredith’s interest in quantum biology, optimizing our light environment, and what it means to create a new paradigm. Quotes “We can be moving towards better and better and better. We might hit the wall or hit a roadblock, but there are many doors of healing.” (16:38-16:45 | Meredith)  “The great news of quantum biology is that life gets better, and our health can get better.” (16:59-17:06 | Meredith)  “Even if we can't fix that mitochondria, our quality of life when we subscribe to the principles of quantum biology, even if we are sick, it's so much better.” (18:16-18:28 | Meredith)  “The quantum biology collective means that we are at a tipping point where the approach to how we understand human biology will change fundamentally and drastically. And it's happening right now.” (19:28-19:47 | Meredith)  “If we don't shift to thinking about our health, we're all going to suffer because the way our modern life is structured will make us sick.” (32:13-32:22 | Meredith)    Links  IG/Twitter/Facebook: @quantumhealthtv Directory website: www.quantumbiologycollective.org Certification website: www.appliedquantumbiology.com Full Summit Recordings: www.quantumbiologycollective.org  To find a practitioner who understand the health principles of quantum biology: www.quantumbiologycollective.org  To become a QBC member and get invites to live deep dives & access to our video library: www.quantumhealthtv.com  To take our 8 week practitioner certification in the science of quantum biology so that you can add it to your existing area of expertise: www.appliedquantumbiology.com    Podcast production and show notes provided by HiveCast.fm",33.38,https://open.spotify.com/episode/312WSgmHfNbls37cBsYJRM,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2022-12-15
40hQDIFjIzKQm7BXzrdPHF,The Transistor Age of Quantum Computing,2022-04-26,"Quantum computing is capturing the fascination and the imagination of the technology world. It's built upon the new and unfamiliar field of quantum physics -- where principles such as superposition and entanglement offer the intrigue of unlocking entirely new opportunities. The world's formerly unsolvable problems of logistics optimization, drug discovery, cybersecurity, and material design could now have a tool that potentially cracks those codes. Futuristic opportunities like solving climate change or operating in the space economy eagerly await on the horizon. Yet for all of the promise that quantum computing holds and all of the attention it's gained from the world's greatest scientists, it's still taking a frustratingly-long time to move beyond the R&D stage. Cloud service providers like Amazon and Microsoft have functional quantum computers that can selectively used in certain capacities. But a commercially-useful, error-corrected quantum computer still out of reach for the world's business leaders to harness. We're still a long way from finding Richard Feynman's Killer App. So what should investors do about this intriguing yet commercially-frustrating quantum opportunity? Are recently-public pure plays in the space like IonQ about to make a quantum leap with upcoming breakthroughs? Are deep-pocketed tech companies like Alphabet going to completely rewrite the semiconductor supply chain? Or will quantum computing still remain in the ""too hard"" pile -- fraught with technical risks, uncertainties, and no generally-agreed-upon commercial path forward? To help us answer those questions, we’ve brought in an expert. Tiernan Ray is one of the technology industry’s best reporters. He's covered the tech landscape for more than two decades – from the early days of the internet and the dotcom boom to the rise of cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Tiernan puts tech progress through a much-needed objective lens, helping investors separate hype from true innovation. He offers daily insights in his Technology Letter publication: www.thetechnologyletter.com. In an exclusive interview with 7investing founder and CEO Simon Erickson, Tiernan describes where quantum computing stands and where it offers the greatest promise. He explains why controlled, multi-variable problems using AI are where quantum could be the most commercially valuable, and how companies will find multiple ways to support and profit from the bigger-picture movement. The two discuss the different technical approaches to quantum computing and the publicly-traded companies who are harnessing them. Tiernan also explains why we're in the ""the transistor age of quantum computing"" and a few recent developments we should be keeping a closer eye on. In the final section, Tiernan shares a few other technology trends he's excited about -- such as why silicon carbide is such an important material for the semiconductor industry and why high-performance computing still offer a long runway for chipmakers like AMD and NVIDIA. Publicly-traded companies mentioned in this interview include Air Liquide, Alphabet, Amazon, AMD, ASML, BMW, Daimler, Form Factor, General Electric, Honeywell, Howard Huges, IBM, Intel, IonQ, Microsoft, NVIDIA, On Semiconductor, Rigetti, Tesla, Texas Instruments, and Wolfspeed. 7investing’s advisors and/or guests may have positions in the companies that are mentioned.  ---   Send in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/7investing/message",37.07,https://open.spotify.com/episode/40hQDIFjIzKQm7BXzrdPHF,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2022-04-26

Almost every electronic device we use today is an example of quantum physics in action. I believe we may now be on the brink of a second quantum revolution as we attempt to harness even more of the power of the quantum world. Quantum computing will impact many sectors, including healthcare, energy, finance, security, and entertainment. However, significant practical challenges must be overcome before this level of large-scale impact is achievable.One of the companies at the forefront of this revolution is IBM.To better understand Quantum Computing, its advantages and its uses, I spoke with Richard Hopkins, an expert in this field.Richard is an IBM Distinguished Engineer and Fellow of the UK's Royal Academy of Engineering.  He was also the nineteenth President of IBM's Academy of Technology. Richard became President after 25 years of field experience as an IT Architect.We covered everything from Quantum 101 right through to how Quantum might help solve some of the world's biggest challenges - a fascinating episode for anyone who has heard of Quantum and wondered - just what is it? We also covered:What is Quantum Computing?How does a Quantum Computer work?When did IBM’s involvement in Quantum start?What is “Quantum Advantage”?The era of “batch computing” is here againWhen would you need to use a Quantum Computer vs a standard computer?The limitations of Quantum ComputersEdge computing and QuantumWorking together as an industryRichard’s journey to working in QuantumBecoming “digitally curious”The future Quantum jobsNon-technical roles in QuantumSectors that can benefit most from QuantumThe IBM Quantum networkIBM’s Quantum roadmapAI and QuantumThe risk of Quantum and encryptionThe need to be “cryptographically agile”The good uses of Quantum ComputingThree actionable actions to better understand the promise of QuantumResources mentioned in this episodeSpeakers for SchoolsIBM Quantum ComputingThe Eisenhower MatrixThinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel KahnemanMore on RichardRichard on LinkedInRichard on TwitterRichard Hopkins RobotsYour Host: Actionable Futurist® & Chief Futurist Andrew GrillFor more on Andrew - what he speaks about and recent talks, please visit ActionableFuturist.com Andrew's Social ChannelsAndrew on LinkedIn@AndrewGrill on Twitter @Andrew.Grill on InstagramKeynote speeches hereAndrew's upcoming book",39.6,https://open.spotify.com/episode/1WNfiQbzuwXJbiqJmhxqrP,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2022-08-21

If you could be literally any kind of being you chose to be, what kind of being would you want to be? What constraints and limitations and flaws would you want to retain because it's part of what makes you, you. And what aspects would you want to improve? If you have like a bad knee, you probably would want to fix the knee. If you're nearsighted, and you could just snap your fingers and have perfect eyesight, that seems pretty attractive, but then if you keep going in that direction, eventually, it's not clear that you're human anymore. You become some sort of idealized ethereal being, and maybe that's a desirable ultimate destiny for humanity, but I'm not sure we would want to rush there immediately. Maybe we would want to take a kind of slower path to get to that destination.""Nick Bostrom is a Swedish-born philosopher with a background in theoretical physics, computational neuroscience, logic, and artificial intelligence, as well as philosophy.

Questo ha il potenziale di rivoluzionare settori come l'intelligenza artificiale, la crittografia, la simulazione di materiali e farmaci, ma anche il settore bancario e dei servizi finanziari.Tuttavia, l'arrivo del Quantum Computing porta con sé una serie di sfide legali. Il quantum computing potrebbe, infatti, minare la sicurezza delle attuali tecnologie di crittografia, esponendo le informazioni sensibili a nuovi rischi. La privacy e la protezione dei dati potrebbero essere messe a dura prova, richiedendo nuovi approcci e regolamenti.Il Quantum Computing potrebbe anche avere un impatto significativo sulla proprietà intellettuale. L'elaborazione di dati e informazioni a livelli mai visti prima potrebbe portare a nuove scoperte e invenzioni, ma anche a dispute legali relative ai diritti di utilizzo e proprietà.Si parla tanto di regolamentazione dell'intelligenza artificiale in questi giorni, ma le infinite possibilità del Quantum Computing richiederanno prima o poi un quadro legislativo adeguato.

2oSN1ql6ofabOMFsVOEM5O,Luis Serrano | Exploring and Explaining Machine Learning and Quantum Computing,2021-10-26,"This week, Melody welcomes AI educator, author, and quantum ML research scientist at Zapata, Luis Serrano, to the Absolute AI podcast. Luis discusses his journey to the world of quantum computing, the enormous potential in this ever evolving field, and his highly successful initiatives to share his knowledge. THE JOURNEY TO QUANTUM COMPUTING Luis’ early interest in Mathematics led him to become a Math professor which sparked even further interest in machine learning and AI. Eventually working at Google and YouTube, Luis was able to combine these interests with his love of teaching. Following his curiosity and a recommendation from a friend he ended up pursuing his increasing fascination with quantum computing, resulting in his current position with Zapata Computing. MACHINE LEARNING AND QUANTUM COMPUTING At Zapata, Luis and his team work at finding quantum advantage and supremacy through the exploration of and experimentation with qubits. There remains a great deal of work to be done to make the vast potential of quantum computing a reality, and Zapata is working on every aspect of it. PODCAST HIGHLIGHTS 1:54     The Journey From International Mathlete to AI to Quantum Computing4:16     The Coalescence of Machine Learning and Quantum Computing at Zapata16:43         Pushing the Physical Boundaries of Quantum Computers20:02         Grokking Machine Learning and Its Universal Appeal26:08         The Impact of AI and Machine Learning on Our Everyday Lives29:41         Educating Within Spanish and Latin American Culture GROKKING MACHINE LEARNING Luis’ highly accessible book demonstrates his skills as an educator. By making the concepts involved more easily understood, he takes away the reader’s apprehension of complexity, and empowers them in the process. AI, MACHINE LEARNING, AND EVERYDAY LIFE Luis believes that we are doing linear regression in our heads all the time which helps us better understand machine learning algorithms. His hugely popular YouTube channel has a particularly enlightening video regarding this concept. EDUCATING WITHIN SPANISH AND LATIN AMERICAN CULTURE While teaching Math and machine learning in Spanish is difficult, Luis enjoys it a great deal because it makes the lessons accessible to those that may not otherwise have the opportunity to learn it due to the current sub sufficient Spanish language resources. The need for diversity in this field is great as AI must reflect all human perspectives if it is to be successful. Luis feels that he is always in some way teaching and so must always be learning something new. More About Luis Serrano Luis is the author of Grokking Machine Learning, the creator of the serrano.academy website and YouTube channel, and a quantum AI research scientist at Zapata Computing where he is involved in developing machine learning algorithms to work in quantum computers. He is also a frequent speaker at artificial intelligence and data science conferences.During his time in Silicon Valley, he worked at the following companies:Apple: Lead AI educator, in charge of teaching machine learning to the employees and doing internal consulting in AI related projects.Udacity: Head of content for AI and Data Science, managing the team that created online courses in AI, ML, Deep Learning, Data Science, etc.Google: Part of the video recommendations team at YouTube, where we trained machine learning algorithms to recommend videos in the main...",38.35,https://open.spotify.com/episode/2oSN1ql6ofabOMFsVOEM5O,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2021-10-26

6ws8KUm3WMdLHc5ojuRDEH,meQuanics - QSI@UTS Seminar Series - S25 - Adrian Chapman (University of Sydney),2022-04-02,"During this time of lockdown, the centre for quantum software and information (QSI) at the University of Technology Sydney has launched an online seminar series.  With talks once or twice a week from leading researchers in the field, meQuanics is supporting this series by mirroring the audio from each talk.  I would encourage if you listen to this episode, to visit and subscribe to the UTS:QSI YouTube page to see each of these talks with the associated slides to help it make more sense. https://youtu.be/4KIXVQtR9Qw Free-Fermion Solutions and Frustration Graphs   TITLE: Characterization of free-fermion-solvable spin models via graph invariants  SPEAKER: Dr Adrian Chapman  AFFILIATION: ARC Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems (EQUS), University of Sydney, Australia  HOSTED BY: A/Prof Chris Ferrie, UTS Centre for Quantum Software and Information   ABSTRACT:  Finding exact solutions to spin models is a fundamental problem of many-body physics. A workhorse technique for exact solution methods is mapping to an effective description by noninteracting fermions. The paradigmatic example of this is the Jordan-Wigner transformation for finding an exact solution to the one-dimensional XY model. Another important example is the exact free-fermion solution to the two-dimensional Kitaev honeycomb model.  I will describe a framework for recognizing general models which can be solved this way by utilizing the tools of graph theory. Our construction relies on a connection to the graph-theoretic problem of recognizing line graphs, which has been solved optimally. A corollary of this result is a complete set of constant-sized frustration structures which obstruct a free-fermion solution. We classify the kinds of Pauli symmetries which can be present in models for which a free-fermion solution exists, and we find that they correspond to either: (i) gauge qubits, (ii) cycles on the free-fermion hopping graph, or (iii) the fermion parity. Clifford symmetries, except in finitely-many cases, must be symmetries of the free-fermion Hamiltonian itself. We expect our characterization to motivate a renewed exploration of free-fermion-solvable models, and I will close with an elaborate discussion of how we expect to generalize our framework beyond generator-to-generator mappings.   RELATED ARTICLES: Characterization of solvable spin models via graph invariants.

2yWKfVM8Z9EyCvKjpOCPFD,4 Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy as Growth Stocks BOOM,2022-12-05,"What’s up, hypergrowth investors? And welcome back to our Hypergrowth Investing podcast! We’re now a few days past the Black Friday/Cyber Monday holiday shopping extravaganza. And this season has been surprisingly strong! Now, we’ve been bullish on retail stocks heading into the holiday shopping season for a while – especially e-commerce stocks. And these sales numbers only bolster our conviction.Analysts expected sales this past weekend to be weak, and it makes sense why. Consumer confidence has plunged to near all-time-low levels. Excess savings has been wiped out. Portfolios have been crushed. Everyone’s talking about a recession. Inflation is still high – so are record sales enough to counteract the year’s dramatic increase in prices? Well, it turns out, yes.According to Mastercard (MA), Black Friday sales were up 12%, and online sales were up 14%. But… how? The labor market is showing some signs of weakness, but it’s still strong. The unemployment rate remains low. So long as consumer still have jobs, they’ll keep spending. And that’s why we think a deep recession in 2023 is unlikely. Our economy has withstood one of the most aggressive quantitative tightening cycles ever, and the U.S. consumer is still chugging along. We’re starting to see reacceleration in e-commerce growth trends. The post-pandemic pent-up demand for in-store shopping has diminished, and folks are returning to online purchases. E-commerce growth trends have normalized, and they’re going strong. That’s not all we’re bullish on… Guess who’s back in the Clubhouse? Bob Iger. And since this CEO changing of the guard, the stock has languished at its COVID lows. But we think Iger’s return is fantastic news for Disney (DIS) stock. Disney is trying to build out its streaming ability to become a tech company, not a legacy one. Former CEO Bob Chapek was on the fence about it. But Bob Iger is bullish on this development. And upon his return, we’re likely to see Disney return to its streaming-first narrative.Is this the new market regime?That’s the ideology we’re seeing everywhere at the moment. But we have trouble with that sentiment. The data strongly supports the idea that what really drives stock prices is earnings. And when you look at earnings guidance for the coming years, it’s the tech stocks that will have tremendous growth. So, while the Dow might be outperforming right now, the Nasdaq’s tech stocks will still reign supreme in the long run. “New School” companies are here to stay.But what about oil? Well, oil and gas are part of those “Old School” stocks. And here in 2022, we’ve been bullish on the “New School” clean tech. Have things changed going into 2023? Nope!Up until this point, each year, companies spent more capital on oil and gas infrastructure and operations than they did on renewable energies. That changed in 2022, helped along by legislation promoting the acceleration of clean energy production around the world. Align with these decisions and invest alongside them. We’re talking solar, hydrogen, energy storage stocks – they’ll continue to work very well going into 2023 and will be some of the market’s biggest winners throughout the 2020s.Before we wrap things up, lets talk about a favorite of ours – quantum computing. The computational power of a quantum computer is exponentially more than that of a classical computer. That has profound implications for nearly every industry out there, and now we’re finally seeing its real-world benefits.But this revolution will take time to take off. There are some promising quantum stocks out there right now. Invest with significant patience. This cake won’t bake overnight.📍Timestamps📍00:00:00 -Intro00:02:42 - Forget it, Luke.

1uA8v9pxMNSLvRHpAsIVyX,#115 – David Wallace on the many-worlds theory of quantum mechanics and its implications,2021-11-12,"Quantum mechanics — our best theory of atoms, molecules, and the subatomic particles that make them up — underpins most of modern physics. But there are varying interpretations of what it means, all of them controversial in their own way.   Famously, quantum theory predicts that with the right setup, a cat can be made to be alive and dead at the same time. On the face of it, that sounds either meaningless or ridiculous.   According to today’s guest, David Wallace — professor at the University of Pittsburgh and one of the world's leading philosophers of physics — there are three broad ways experts react to this apparent dilemma:   1. The theory must be wrong, and we need to change our philosophy to fix it.   2. The theory must be wrong, and we need to change our physics to fix it.  3. The theory is OK, and cats really can in some way be alive and dead simultaneously.   (David and Rob do their best to introduce quantum mechanics in the first 35 minutes of the episode, but it isn't the easiest thing to explain via audio alone. So if you need a refresher before jumping in, we recommend checking out our links to learn more, summary and full transcript.)  In 1955, physicist Hugh Everett bit the bullet on Option 3 and proposed Wallace's preferred solution to the puzzle: each time it's faced with a ‘quantum choice,’ the universe 'splits' into different worlds. Anything that has a probability greater than zero (from the perspective of quantum theory) happens in some branch — though more probable things happen in far more branches.   While not a consensus position, the ‘many-worlds’ approach is one of the top three most popular ways to make sense of what's going on, according to surveys of relevant experts.   Setting aside whether it's correct for a moment, one thing that's not often spelled out is what this approach would concretely imply if it were right.   Is there a world where Rob (the show's host) can roll a die a million times, and it comes up 6 every time?   As David explains in this episode: absolutely, that’s completely possible  — and if Rob rolled a die a million times, there would be a world like that.   Is there a world where Rob becomes president of the US?   David thinks probably not. The things stopping Rob from becoming US president don’t seem down to random chance at the quantum level.   Is there a world where Rob deliberately murdered someone this morning?   Only if he’s already predisposed to murder — becoming a different person in that way probably isn’t a matter of random fluctuations in our brains.   Is there a world where a horse-version of Rob hosts the 80,000 Horses Podcast?   Well, due to the chance involved in evolution, it’s plausible that there are worlds where humans didn’t evolve, and intelligent horses have in some sense taken their place. And somewhere, fantastically distantly across the vast multiverse, there might even be a horse named Rob Wiblin who hosts a podcast, and who sounds remarkably like Rob. Though even then — it wouldn’t actually be Rob in the way we normally think of personal identity.   Rob and David also cover:   • If the many-worlds interpretation is right, should that change how we live our lives?  • Are our actions getting more (or less) important as the universe splits into finer and finer threads?  • Could we conceivably influence other branches of the multiverse?  • Alternatives to the many-worlds interpretation  • The practical value of physics today  • And much more   Get this episode by subscribing to our podcast on the world’s most pressing problems and how to solve them: type 80,000 Hours into your podcasting app.   Producer: Keiran Harris Audio mastering: Ben Cordell Transcriptions: Sofia Davis-Fogel and Katy Moore",189.78,https://open.spotify.com/episode/1uA8v9pxMNSLvRHpAsIVyX,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2021-11-12

I braced myself for an interview during which I delved into content that I wouldn't understand - I shake my head just thinking about getting myself into that! It wasn't as bad as I'd feared. It seemed that my attempt to prepare helped. Rob didn't laugh at me, and I am proud that during this episode he said. ""Hey, we're only 10 minutes into this and you're getting it."" That was kind of him because no, I don't get quantum physics. What I did come to appreciate during our conversation is what quantum computing can do for humanity.

At university, he focused on quantum because he always wanted to work on a frontier technology whose primary goal was to have an effect on the world. Worth noting that a Ph.D. in physics is NOT required to work at Horizon. Senior program manager Amanda Chew recently joined from Microsoft and brings her experience developing software solutions to the quantum world. Check it out by clicking on sound bar at bottom of page here. Biography of Dr. Joseph Fitzsimons Dr. Joe Fitzsimons left a tenured faculty position at Singapore University of Technology and Design to found Horizon Quantum Computing in 2018. Drawing on over 15 years’ experience in quantum computing and computational complexity theory, his goal is to make quantum computing a general-purpose computing technology, capable of addressing some of the world’s most challenging computational problems. Joe received a BSc in Theoretical Physics from University College Dublin and a DPhil from Oxford, where he went on to become a fellow of Merton College. Dr. Fitzsimons has been named as a National Research Foundation Fellow and to the MIT Technology Review’s list of Innovators Under 35 Asia. His company Horizon Quantum Computing is pioneering an approach to quantum computing that allows users to write programs in classical languages that can be compiled and run on conventional or quantum computers, without any knowledge in quantum computing. By removing the need for prior quantum computing experience, Horizon’s tools will democratize the development of quantum-enhanced applications, making the power of quantum computing accessible to every software developer. About Horizon Computing Horizon Computing is working to democratise quantum computing applications for businesses by removing the need for quantum algorithms knowledge for software developers. For that, Horizon Computing is building a compiler that automatically constructs quantum algorithms from classical code. The company was founded in 2018 in Singapore by Dr Joe Fitzsimons, DPhil from Oxford, a specialist in quantum computing and computational complexity theory with over 15 years of experience. The leadership team also includes Dr Si-Hui Tan, PhD from MIT, who has been actively involved in quantum research for 15 years.

5vBJ7vRapuFIBY1EJYEO3Q,Quantum Computing,2021-06-30,"In 1935, the famous physicist Erwin Schrödinger was debating with his friend Albert Einstein about the nature of a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics – a field that was, at the time, still very new. To illustrate his point, Schrödinger proposed a thought experiment wherein a (rather unfortunate) cat sealed in a box is both alive and dead simultaneously – up until the moment someone opens the box. Decades later, that abstract paradox is still very much alive, and enabling the development of a new generation of computers. These quantum computers use bits (called qubits) that, unlike the binary bits in today’s electronics, can simultaneously exist in many states between on and off. And although the word gets overused in science, this emerging technology really is revolutionary. A fully developed quantum computer is predicted to be able to perform calculations that would be impossible for a traditional supercomputer, even with thousands of years of processing time.In this episode, our experts chat about the current state of quantum computers and explain why the mind-bending theories of quantum make coming to work a lot of fun.Featuring:Irfan Siddiqi is a professor at UC Berkeley, where he leads the Quantum Nanoelectronics Laboratory, a collaborative group dedicated to developing new and improved superconducting qubits. He is also a faculty scientist at Berkeley Lab, where he leads the Advanced Quantum Testbed and the Quantum Systems Accelerator – a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center.Zahra Pedramrazi is a project scientist at the Advanced Quantum Testbed. During her physics undergraduate, she took a quantum class with Irfan, and became hooked on the field. She is currently focused on the fabrication of superconducting qubits, working to refine their design in order to overcome the limitations of current qubits.""Thus, the task is, not so much to see what no one has yet seen; but to think what nobody has yet thought, about that which everybody sees."" ― Erwin Schrödinger“How wonderful that we have met with a paradox.

0U8cNxhEzbOkEGGpDc6ukr,Practical Quantum Computing Advantage for Businesses – with Alex Condello from D-Wave,2021-11-17,"D-Wave has been making quantum computers for over a decade, and their annealers excel at optimization. If you look at the use cases the company has been helping customers with, it almost feels like quantum advantage is here. If you’re saving time or money, or both, how can you complain? And even after the other type of quantum computers, universal-gate-based systems, become fault tolerant, annealers will likely be around forever due to how powerful they are at specific use cases (sort of like how graphics cards work alongside CPUs).

What is quantum superposition and entanglement and are they anything more than just science fiction? In this episode we answer these questions by talking with Dr Mark Jackson, a Quantum Evangelist at Cambridge Quantum. The company, founded just seven years ago at the University of Cambridge, is a powerful advocate for the future of quantum computing, and Mark is at the forefront of such innovation.  After a mind-blowing investigation of quantum effects we settled down to explore the many ways in which Quantum Computing is helping a surprisingly wide array of industries to use the technology - pharmaceuticals, finance, chemistry and materials science are among the first. Could we ever have a future in which our medical treatment and drugs were specially tailored to our individual bodies?

Now working at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in quantum computing. Sadly, India is not in the top 10 countries in this technology that is set to defeat all conventional systems.

QC will create breakthroughs in fields like satellites, medicine, energy, materials science, finance, telecommunications. The Indian budget for QC has recently increased but still small compared to USA and China.  Furthermore, Indians’ work in this is scattered and casually coordinated without a large-scale central body.
