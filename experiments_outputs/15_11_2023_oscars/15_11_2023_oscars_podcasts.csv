Perhaps the most famous gay martyr in history, Wilde is often presented as a sacrificial victim destroyed by a bigoted and puritanical establishment. But the story of how Wilde came to prominence, and eventually sued his lover’s father for libel, is one as surprising as it is complex.

If you can remember back to just five years ago, the Oscars were coming off the heels of a couple of years of great winners from the Academy, with Spotlight, Moonlight, and The Shape of Water taking home the previous three Best Picture prizes. It looked like, with new members added every year, the Oscars were done giving disappointing winners their top honor, but the 2018 Oscar season proved to be a massive step back for the Academy as Green Book won Best Picture, and went down in history as one of the worst winners in Oscar history. Moreover, the season not only had other films of questionable quality nominated as well, but it started a path towards a host-less ceremony, ideas of cutting categories, not inviting the acting winners from the year before to the ceremony to present, and other problems that would come up in one form or another for the next few years at the Oscars.   In this in depth retrospective, Ryan, Sophia and Dan break down the year in film, the good and bad nominees, and the overall legacy of Green Book’s win and the rest of the winners on the night. They also talked about where they were at just five years ago, the campaigning that got us this Best Picture win, and how similar tactics have been used since for both good and bad reasons. After doing that, Ryan gave out some Oscar Trivia for Sophia and Dan to answer, and then they got into playing 'Should’ve, Could've, Would’ve,' where they replace nominees from the 91st Academy Awards and give out their personal winners for the year. The films included in their discussion ranged from If Beale Street Could Talk, Burning, Leave No Trace, A Simple Plan, First Reformed, Hereditary, Widows, BlacKkKlansman, Private Life, Roma, First Man, The Old Man and the Gun, Disobedience, Suspiria, The Favourite, Paddington 2, Can You Ever Forgive Me, Blindspotting, Wildlife, and so many more.   You can listen to The AwardsWatch Podcast wherever you stream podcasts, from iTunes, iHeartRadio, Soundcloud, Stitcher, Spotify, Audible, Amazon Music and more.   This podcast runs 2h32m. We will be back next week to talk about our Top 5 Best/Worst franchise reboots, inspired by the latest Exorcist revival. Till then, let’s get into it.

3rOUKk0FZfyzSVPLaxSTxU,Oscar Wilde,2001-12-06,"Melvyn Bragg examines Oscar Wilde and the Aesthetes. In February 1895 Oscar Wilde was at the height of his powers, he was known on both sides of the Atlantic, he was feted in London society and celebrated in the West End where An Ideal Husband continued to play to packed houses as The Importance of Being Earnest opened to ecstatic reviews. “The man who can dominate a London dinner table can dominate the world” he is reputed to have said, and he seemed on course to do just that. But in April that year he was arrested for the crime of ‘gross indecency’ and his swift decent from omnipotence began; it ended five years later, when exiled and humiliated he died, famously ‘beyond his means’, in a Paris hotel.Wilde’s reputation spent a long time in the wilderness but just over a century after his death his stock is higher than ever before.  Now that his rehabilitation seems complete how should we understand his legacy? Was Wilde a reactionary - the last of the romantics - or was he the midwife to modernism? Was there a coherent philosophy behind those beguiling epigrams or was there little more to aestheticism than dressing up and showing off? With Valentine Cunningham, Professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford University, Regenia Gagnier, Professor of English at the University of Exeter and Neil Sammells, Dean of Humanities at Bath Spa University and author of Wilde Style.",28.29,https://open.spotify.com/episode/3rOUKk0FZfyzSVPLaxSTxU,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['rehabilitation'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2001-12-06

But it seems he has the potential to match the pressure. In three consecutive years, he became Formula Renault, Formula 3 and Formula 2 champion. After winning the F2 championship, there was no space on the grid for the 2022 F1 season and Piastri had to take a year out from racing. But now his chance has arrived. McLaren have given him the opportunity to prove himself at the top and he’s keen to emulate the success of fellow Australians, Mark Webber and Daniel Ricciardo. Piastri tells Tom Clarkson about leaving home at a young age and how his career in motorsport began with remote control racing. Although last season’s battle for Piastri’s signature between McLaren and Alpine is behind them, there’s now more attention on him than most F1 debutants are used to.

It would be chasing an Oscar.For 16 years during her professional triathlon career, Lesley fought to secure and maintain the film rights to All Quiet on the Western Front out of her own pocket from race winnings. She wrote and rewrote the script, and despite the odds stacked heavily against her, never gave up on her dream of getting the movie made.After many years of starts and stops the film was finally released and took home four Oscars and seven BAFTAs—including one for best-adapted screenplay (this was Lesley’s first screenplay might I add). All of which is a testament to her patience, discipline, and hard work.Lesley’s relentless persistence is the focus of today’s conversation, along with the importance of self-belief, playing the long game, and the ‘never quit’ drive required to crush audacious goals.Delightful, engaging, and strong, I adore Lesley. There’s a lot to learn from this fiery Scottish lassie.Note: If you like this exchange, be sure to check out her book The Brave Athlete, which is packed with actionable practices to build an endurance mindset.Show notes + MOREWatch on YouTubeNewsletter Sign-UpToday’s Sponsors:Seed: seed.com/RICHROLLBetterHelp: BetterHelp.com/RICHROLLSquarespace: Squarespace.com/RICHROLLMomentous: LiveMomentous.com/richroll Indeed: Indeed.com/RICHROLLBabbel: Babbel.com/RICHROLLPlant Power Meal Planner: https://meals.richroll.comPeace + Plants,Rich",144.3,https://open.spotify.com/episode/4iskum6b1hGMPAZ153YnmM,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-08-21

72Vs9yuK6mFKERFDKTAOKP,The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde,2023-11-10,"Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) was a renowned Irish playwright, poet, and author known for his exceptional wit, flamboyant style, and profound contributions to late 19th-century literature. Born in Dublin, Wilde attended Oxford University and soon established himself as a prominent figure in London's literary and social circles. His works, including ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and ""The Importance of Being Earnest,"" are celebrated for their clever dialogue, social satire, and exploration of the human condition. Wilde's unique blend of comedy, satire, and poignant commentary on Victorian society made him one of the most influential figures of his time. Unfortunately, his career took a tragic turn when he was convicted of ""gross indecency"" for his homosexuality, leading to his imprisonment and eventual death in Paris.""The Canterville Ghost"" is a classic novella penned by Oscar Wilde, first published in 1887. This humorous and haunting tale tells the story of the Otis family, Americans who move into Canterville Chase, a grand old English manor said to be haunted by Sir Simon, a ghost from centuries past. The novella is an exemplary demonstration of Wilde's wit and comedic genius, as he contrasts American pragmatism with British aristocracy and tradition. Wilde's sharp observations and clever humor in ""The Canterville Ghost"" provide a refreshing take on the traditional ghost story genre, injecting it with a delightful blend of satire and hilarity.Published during Wilde's literary peak, the novella garnered critical acclaim for its innovation and wit, positioning it as a unique departure from the conventional ghost stories of its era. Its humorous exploration of the clash between the Old World and the New World captivated readers. While it did not receive as much attention as some of Wilde's other works, ""The Canterville Ghost"" remains a cherished piece of literature and a testament to his enduring influence on the literary world.

Geena Davis, the star of such seminal movies as Tootsie, Beetlejuice, Thelma & Louise, A League of Their Own and the underrated classic, The Long Kiss Goodnight, TURNED UP AT MY ACTUAL HOUSE to record a witty, warm and fascinating conversation.*We talk about her feelings of imposter syndrome and self-doubt in the early days of her career, the fact that her failure as a model led to her first film role alongside Dustin Hoffman (who gave her incredible advice on how to defend herself against the amorous advances of her male co-stars) and the revelation of being diagnosed with ADD in her 40s. Along the way, we touch on height (she's 6ft!

Before they get into their final festival experience of the year, the 2023 Gotham Awards were  announced last week, giving us the first nominations of the upcoming Oscar season. Voted on by a jury system of selected critics, the films listed comprised of some of the best indie films of the year, including Past Lives, Passages, Showing Up, A Thousand and One, All of Us Strangers and more. This year, the organization removed the budget cap requirements, which limited the film’s that could be considered for consideration to anything made for less than $35 million. Once they were done discussing that, Ryan and Sophia moved on to briefly talk about a big release that debuted in theaters while the podcast was off last week, Killers of the Flower Moon, and why it is one of the best films of the year, in their opinion.   After they were done talking about Scorsese’s latest, they moved on to the AFI FEST, that saw the world premieres of films like  Leave the World Behind and  Freud’s Last Session and closed with Bradley Cooper’s Maestro. Ryan and Sophia talk about those films, as well as their thoughts on Perfect Days, La Chimera, American Fiction, and two highlights, A Matter of Life and Death and All That Jazz, from Greta Gerwig’s special Guest Director section, showcasing five big screen classics.   You can listen to The AwardsWatch Podcast wherever you stream podcasts, from iTunes, iHeartRadio, Soundcloud, Stitcher, Spotify, Audible, Amazon Music and more.   This podcast runs 1h27m.

In less than three weeks, the Fall film festivals will be in full swing around the globe, as dozens and dozens of films premiere with great optimism that they will have what it takes to carry over in the award season conversation. While we know most of the film festival lineups and where everything will be playing, no one can predict at this exact moment in time what the nominations and winners will be come March 2024. With this in mind, we are at the start of a brand new Oscar season, thus the AW team has come together to give their first podcast Oscar predictions before the world premieres at the Venice, Telluride, and Toronto Film Festivals.   Erik has been covering the monthly Oscar predictions on the site, but these predictions are the first chance for Ryan, Josh, and Zach to talk with Erik as a group and see where everyone is right now, who are the early frontrunners, and which films have what it takes to make it all the way to Hollywood’s biggest night. Their conversation covered the Best Picture category, as well as Best Director, both Original and Adapted Screenplay, and all four of the acting categories. Among the several films that were highlighted the most in the team’s conversation include Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, The Zone of Interest, Barbie, Past Lives, The Holdovers, Dune Part Two, Maestro, May December, Anatomy of a Fall, Air, Saltburn, The Killer, Ferrari, Nyad, Priscilla, The Iron Claw and Poor Things, with a hand full of other titles like Asteroid City, Dumb Money, Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse, The Color Purple, Long Day’s Journey into Night and Rustin also getting some consideration.It was a detailed, exciting podcast that we hope you enjoy.

Matt Spraker and Simul Parikh) host radiation oncologists Dr. Jona Hattangadi-Gluth and PGY-5 resident Dr. Austin Hopper. Jona is a central nervous system malignancies expert, co-lead of the Central Nervous System Disease Team and Associate Professor of Radiation Oncology at UC San Diego. In this episode, we discuss Jona's lab's work in understanding the link between brain tumors, radiation (and other) treatments, and neurocognitive toxicity. We start by discussing Austin's recently presented work that developed an normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model for radiation dose and attention/processing speed. Later, we discuss specific methods used in the NTCP work. How can this work be translated to clinical counseling and practice? Also, Matt argues that building NTCP models based on neurocognitive outcomes, such as attention or fine motor control, can be more difficult to model than more simple clinical outcomes such as pneumonitis.Here are some links to things we discussed during the show:Connor et al., 2023.

But I think that has been proven wrong time and time again,” Cruz says.“It’s like a political election,” Jacobs says, “or a sports contest that turns on a single play or call. These books really reveal that. It’s just interesting how many times Oscar — as one of these books puts it — gets it wrong. Like, the movie that won isn’t the one that you remember, or isn’t the one that time judges as the best one. That’s fascinating to see. … You might ask, What does this ceremony matter if it’s not even adjudicating properly? But I think it matters because — look, it’s the electronic hearth around which we gather. I think it matters because people crave communal entertainment experiences.”We would love to hear your thoughts about this episode, and about the Book Review’s podcast in general.

0QL2JItnA2UAMr8KfYw2CI,Have you heard about postnatal depletion? Tips for the fourth trimester - with Dr Oscar Serrallach,2022-10-31,"In our 154th episode of Beyond the Bump, we chat with the incredible Dr Oscar Serrallach. He is a functional GP and an expert in postnatal depletion, and we chat to him all about how to better prepare for the postnatal period. Oscar talks about his struggle in finding resources and information about depletion and what women were going through! What is ‘normal’ within the postpartum period? How can we distinguish ‘normal’ postnatal fatigue versus postnatal depletion? Is postnatal depletion like a spectrum? If you’ve got postnatal depletion, are you on your way to postnatal depression and/or anxiety? Why something traumatic happing during your pregnancy could have a significant impact on a women’s fourth trimester What are some things, at a societal, family, or individual level, that we can put into place to make a significant difference during the postpartum period? How can we, in our very isolated homes and fast-paced lives, introduce some of these more traditional practices in a realistic way? Is postpartum depletion worse in those women that stay at home versus those that go back to work? Does vaginal birth or having a caesarean make a difference in postpartum depletion? If we feel like we are depleted is there a test that we can do to confirm it? Postpartum hair loss!! Why does it happen? Is there anything we can do to avoid and/or manage it? And is it linked to depletion? Are there any supplements or nutrients women should take postpartum? And SO MUCH MORE!!!    Beyond the Bump is a podcast brought to you by Jayde Couldwell and Sophie Pearce! A podcast targeted at mums, just like you!

For months, the AW podcast team have talked about the state of modern movie stars, and what the future of cinema looks like. Given how the trend of the film industry is leaning more towards IP driven films as well as a big point of emphasis on director’s names attached to projects, the role, and criteria of what we have considered a traditional movie star has changed. With this in mind, Ryan, Sophia, Josh, and Jay put together a list of forty names of actors mostly under the age of forty who they believe have the potential to be the movie stars of the future and help carry movies like the stars before them. The list of names included a wide range of talent like Timothée Chalamet, Margot Robbie, Emma Stone, Daniel Kaluuya, Austin Butler, Paul Mescal, Zendaya, Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and many more the team had to decide if they were going to buy, sell, or hold the stock of these potential movie stars.

Keyifli dinlemeler... Konuk Ses: Sezen Özyıldız İllüstrasyonlar: Sezen Özyıldız https://instagram.com/sezendraws #evdekal #seslikitap #seslikitapdinle   1854 doğumlu olan Oscar Wilde, 9 yaşına kadar evde eğitim almıştır. Daha sonra Portora Kraliyet Okulu'na yazılmıştır. Bıradan mezun oldukran sonra Dublin'deki Trinity Kolejine giren Oscar Wilde 1871’den 1874’e kadar burada eğitim aldı. Başarılı bir öğrenci olan Oscar Wilde, Trinity öğrencileri için en büyük ödül olan Berkeley altın madalyasını ve aynı zamanda Oxford Üniversitesi Magdalen Koleji'nden bir burs kazanmıştır. Burada 1874'den 1878'e kadar eğitimini sürdürdü. Magdalen'deyken Ravenna adlı şiiriyle 1878 Newdigate Ödülü'nü kazandı.  Oxford’dan mezun olduktan sonra Wilde, memleketi Dublin'e geri döndü ve burada Florence Balcomb ile tanıştı. Florence, yazar Bram Stoker ile nişanlanınca Oscar, ona İrlanda'yı terk edeceğini yazdı. 1878'de İrlanda'dan ayrıldı ve buraya küçük ziyaretler gerçekleştirmek için, sadece iki kez döndü. Wilde sonraki altı yılını Paris, Londra ve ABD'de geçirdi. Londra'da kraliçenin danışmanlarından olan Horace Lloyd'un kızı Constance Lloyd ile tanıştı. Wilde ve Lloyd 29 Mayıs 1884'te Paddington, Londra'da evlendiler. Çiftin bu evlilikten iki çocukları oldu.  Wilde hayatının büyük bir bölümü boyunca sosyalizmi destekledi. Ayrıca özgürlükçü yanını da Sonnet to Liberty şiiriyle gösterdi. Wilde ayrıca bir pasifistti. Ve “Özgürlük kanlı elleriyle geldiğinde onunla el sıkışmak zor olacak.” demişti. Politika hakkındaki ana yazısı “Sosyalizmin Etkisindeki İnsan Ruhu” dışında Daily Chronicles'a hapishane reformunu destekleyen yazılar yazmıştı. Lady Florence Dixie'nin 1890'da yazdığı Gloriana ya da 1900 Devrimi adlı romanda Hector l’Estrange kılığındaki Gloriana'nın Avam Kamarası’na seçilmesiyle kadınlar oy hakkı kazanıyordu. Dixie'nin l'Estrange karakterini yaratırken Wilde'ı temel aldığı açıktır.  ---   Send in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/seslikitapdunyasi/message",25.69,https://open.spotify.com/episode/7y4tdicPV7XIW3zd0TkfP3,['tr'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2020-12-28

Nach anfänglichen Komplikationen scheint dem jungen Glück nichts mehr im Wege zu stehen. Als dann auch noch Baby Brian geboren wird, wirkt alles perfekt. Doch etwas stimmt nicht, fühlt sich ganz und gar falsch an! Emmy stellt sich die Frage: Ist Brain vielleicht gar nicht ihr Baby?Wer jetzt an Genre-Klassiker wie ""Rosemaries Baby"" oder ""Das Omen"" denken muss, liegt nicht daneben. Die Miniserie ""The Changeling"" - zu streamen bei Apple TV+ - macht keinen Hehl daraus, auf welchen Spuren sie wandelt. Die acht Episoden basieren auf dem gleichnamigen Roman des US-Autors Victor LaValle, der im Originalton auch als Erzähler zu hören ist. LaValle gelingt es, die bekannte Geschichte neu zu interpretieren. Wer Horror in anmutig komponierten Bildern mit komplexen Charakteren mag, sollte ""The Changeling"" eine Chance geben.Eine ausführliche Kritik zu ""The Changeling"" von Ronny Rüsch und Axel Max - jetzt in einer neuen Folge des ntv-Podcasts ""Oscars & Himbeeren"".

Hackman eventually backed out of the project, but a screenplay adaptation from Ted Tally was already in the works so he was encouraged to finish.  Jonathan Demme was eventually brought onto direct the film and he immediately fell in love with the book and then the screenplay with production starting only a few months later.  The film starred Jodie Foster as an ambitious young FBI agent tasked with exploring the mind of famed psychopath played by Anthony Hopkins with hopes of earning his help to track down a serial killer named Buffalo Bill… In the latest episode of Rewind of the Living Dead, we’re going to eat some liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti as we look back at the 1991 film “The Silence of the Lambs”…    ",128.62,https://open.spotify.com/episode/6qL7NkNYPttGzaglhnGjf7,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['liver'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-06-14

Jede Geste, jeder Blick, jede Bewegung, die die 44-Jährige ihrer Rolle verleiht, atmet das, was Serienschöpfer Dave Filoni, der noch bei Mastermind George Lucas in die Schule ging, sich unter einem nahezu perfekten Jedi vorstellt.Noch nie hat man als ""Star Wars""-Fan die fast schon religiöse Aura eines Krieger-Mönchs in solcher Reinheit und Perfektion gesehen. Dass ""Ahsoka"" nebenbei auch ein Paradebeispiel für eine Bandbreite an starken weiblichen Charakteren bietet, ist wie die Kirsche auf der Sahnehaube.Eine ausführliche Kritik zu ""Ahsoka"" von Ronny Rüsch und Axel Max - jetzt in einer neuen Folge des ntv-Podcasts ""Oscars & Himbeeren"".

La televisión como vehículo para ayudar a la sociedad. ¿Qué marcas lo hacen posible? ¿Cómo es producir televisión real y en vivo? ¡Escúchelo ahora mismo por #RadioReal de Gonzalo Oliveros. Y ¿sabe qué? ¡no se deje!   Empezamos con esta entrevista doble: Jorge Garralda, que está frente a las cámaras y es el líder del equipo, y Óscar Hernández, el productor que logra que todo suceda. La primera pregunta: ¿por qué no hay más programas de acción social? La respuesta… no lo sorprenderá. Otra pregunta tremenda: ¿Por qué las marcas no están peléandose por trabajar con “A quien corresponda”? Porque a sus agencias no les interesa. ¡Tomen! Casos de Danone, CEMEX y McDonald´s.  El secreto: la transparencia. La gente sabe lo que hace, con qué empresas lo hace.  El Juguetón: 29 generaciones haciéndolo.  La labor social y la perspectiva en los problemas. Se trata de ponerse en los zapatos de los demás.  Producir televisión social. El primer reto: el presupuesto. Es ahí donde la creatividad florece; y la fórmula del éxito siempre es crear historias de vida. Historias reales, con personas reales.  El segundo reto: la televisión realmente en vivo, sin guión. Cinco programas a la semana. Durante 29 años. ¿Qué implica técnicamente?  La historia de Jorge Garralda, desde IMEVISION. El primer “A quien corresponda” que se llamaba simplemente Buzón. Cuando lo que se decía en la televisión, se reportaba a la Secretaria de Gobernación.  La marca “A quien corresponda” y la importancia de registrarlo. La caducidad de la gente de los medios. Si llegas a un medio donde los conductores tienen 40 años… difícilmente tendrás una oportunidad. ¡Tómenla!  La comunicación entre conductor y productor. Casi matrimonial. Es indispensable, sobre todo cuando se produce en vivo. ¿Qué hacer si se va la luz? Entérese. La terrible realidad en México hace necesaria este tipo de televisión. ¿Cómo se produce en vivo en una zona de tragedia?

In addition to attempting to make its annual Oscars telecast shorter (three hours now), and to move the date of the show earlier (February 9 by 2020), the Academy announced a new category honoring Achievement in Popular Film. Wow. How will they define ""Popular""? What exactly does ""Achievement"" mean? And doesn't this decision water down the eventual Best Picture winner? Sean O'Connell, Jake Hamilton, and Kevin McCarthy try to answer these questions, as well as react to IMAX footage of Damien Chazelle's ""First Man,"" their thoughts on ""The Meg,"" and wrap things up with their favorite movie endings. #EndingBlend Special thanks to @ShutUpKaleena for our awesome intro this week!

The Academy Awards has sucked up a lot of time this week, but don’t worry we’ve found a corner to chat about the Vulva Spacecraft.

3DoXdTJUPjBBr91WsQBi4r,Ep.286: Il premio Oscar e uno scherzo telefonico di Navalny,2023-03-14,"L’Oscar per il miglior documentario lo ha vinto “Navalny”. Non il dissidente russo ma il regista del documentario su di lui, che ha per titolo il suo nome. È la storia di come i giornalisti investigativi di Bellingcat hanno stanato e individuato i responsabili dell’avvelenamento di Navalny nel 2020. Grazie all’analisi dei metadati delle telefonate di vari funzionari russi - che in Russia grazie al mercato nero si possono comprare - incrociate con quelle di database trapelati negli ultimi anni, Bellingcat ha scoperto diverse cose: che una squadra di funzionari composta sia da agenti segreti che da esperti di armi chimiche seguivano Navalny da anni, che sull’aereo che aveva preso il dissidente c’erano dei passeggeri “fantasmi” cioè delle spie. Fino al finale piuttosto divertente (per quanto possibile date le circostanze), con i giornalisti di Bellingcat e Navalny seduti intorno a un tavolo, davanti alle telecamere, pronti per uno scherzo telefonico abbastanza atipico.

5dDgVJqJ0HlWfxWrP4IOVO,229. Karl-Gustav Magic art,2023-10-18,"Bonusavsnitt se videoklipp på våran Youtube kanal Oscar & Fredrik  Karl-Gustav Wilhelmsson, född 1963 i den vackra staden Stockholm, är verkligen en konstnär med en passion som har följt honom ända sedan barndomen. Hans kärlek till måleri och teckning har verkligen blivit en viktig del av hans liv. Han har huvudsakligen utforskat traditionella tekniker som olja och akvarell för att bygga upp sin konstnärliga grund.   Men det som verkligen särskiljer Karl-Gustav är hans äventyrliga inställning till konst. Han har varit öppen för att utforska nya uttrycksmedel och har kastat sig in i spännande äventyr inom andra konstformer, inklusive träarbeten och datagrafik. Det är tydligt att han aldrig har förlorat sin passion för att skapa, och hans kreativitet har alltid varit en stark drivkraft i hans liv.   För Karl-Gustav handlar konst om att förmedla de djupa impulser som bor inom honom. Genom sitt skapande har han kunnat uttrycka sig på många olika sätt och i olika projekt. Hans strävan har alltid varit att utmana sig själv och utforska nya vägar och metoder för att rika hans konstnärliga uttryck. Samtidigt har han kontinuerligt förfinat sina färdigheter inom de tekniker han älskar, vilket har gett hans verk en djupare dimension och en kvalitet som bäddar för den essens han önskar förmedla.   Karl-Gustav Wilhelmsson är verkligen en genuin konstnär, en individ som skapar konst i sitt innersta. Han är ständigt ivrig att växa och utvecklas och hans konst är en konstant utforskning av möjligheterna som konstens värld har att erbjuda",11.66,https://open.spotify.com/episode/5dDgVJqJ0HlWfxWrP4IOVO,['sv'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-10-18

Malgré l’amputation de ses deux jambes à l'âge de 11 mois, il s’est hissé parmi les étoiles de l’athlétisme mondial. Rien ne laissait présager que ce Dieu des stades tomberait de son piédestal. Des jeux olympiques au tribunal, de la médaille d’or au barreau de la prison. Dans Home(icides), Caroline Nogueras vous raconte l’histoire tragique d’Oscar Pistorius.   La face cachée du héros Oscar Pistorius a-t-il assassiné sa compagne au cours d’une dispute qui a mal tourné ou l’a-t-il tué accidentellement en la prenant pour un cambrioleur ? Cette question divise et passionne l’Afrique du Sud. Le 22 février 2013, une semaine après le drame, la cour de Pretoria examine la demande de libération sous caution de l’athlète. Le juge s’est retiré plusieurs heures. Quand il pénètre dans la salle d’audience pour annoncer sa décision, les caméras n’ont pas été conviées. Dans le box, Pistorius débout, regard baissé, sait que derrière lui, son clan soudé le soutient.

1XqGxV8zvpy66wqc1hkSZi,AwardsWatch Podcast #203: The WGA Strikes an Historic Deal and our Top 5 Sci-Fi Films of All Time,2023-10-02,"  On episode 203 of The AwardsWatch Podcast, Executive Editor Ryan McQuade is joined by AwardsWatch contributors Nicole Ackman and Dan Bayer to give out their Top 5 Sci-Fi films of all time.   Before the team gets into the Top 5 for this week, they discuss the historic deal that the WGA was able to make with the major film studios. In an important step in the right direction, the 148-day strike came to an end on September 27, with the writers getting a three-year deal that met every important demand that they wanted, including better pay, full transparency when it comes to streaming numbers, and the avoidance of A.I being a part of writer’s rooms and letting creatives still run their own projects. While SAG-AFTRA is still looking to make their own deal and their strike is still ongoing, this is a huge win for not just the WGA but workers and unions all around this country.   Moving on from this very important news, Ryan, Nicole and Dan move on to talk about their Top 5 Sci-Fi films, a topic inspired by the release of The Creator,  which Nicole reviewed on the website this past week. It is another difficult list for the team to put together, having to consider not just their favorite films in the genre, but which films also honor the genre the best in asking questions about the state of our modern world in mostly futuristic settings. It is one of the richest genres in film history, and the titles selected like Blade Runner, Never Let Me Go, Avatar, The Matrix, Star Wars, Total Recall, Children of Men, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Back to the Future only scratch the surface in how many wonderful sci-fi films there are, which led to a really great conversation by the team.   You can listen to The AwardsWatch Podcast wherever you stream podcasts, from iTunes, iHeartRadio, Soundcloud, Stitcher, Spotify, Audible, Amazon Music and more.   This podcast runs 1h50m. We will be back next week with a brand new AwardsWatch Oscar retrospective, talking about the 91st Academy Awards, covering the films of 2018. Till then, let’s get into it.

Lee to give their reactions to the films they saw at the 48th edition of the Toronto International Film Festival. A couple of weeks back, Ryan and Erik gave their reactions to the Telluride Film Festival, one of the first film festivals to start of the fall festival season. After they left the mountains of Colorado, they got their passports ready and headed north to Canada for the annual Toronto International Film Festival. Known for having big Oscar contenders premiere and star-studded red carpets, because of the ongoing SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, TIFF was not as glamorous as years past. But with close to 300 movies from around the world screening across a week and a half, there was still plenty of good films that the gang saw that they were able to share their opinions on.  Before getting into the films, Ryan, Erik, Dan, and Kevin talk about their TIFF experience in terms of what it is like to attend the festival, the ticketing system, and how the screenings work for press and general audiences going to the festival. Then they went on to discuss the three films that won the TIFF People’s Choice Awards: American Fiction, The Holdovers, and The Boy and the Heron. After giving their thoughts on TIFF winners, they went on to gives thoughts on tons of films that included Next Goal Wins, Monster, Dumb Money, Sing Sing, Rustin, His Three Daughters, Woman of the Hour, Dream Scenario, Evil Does Not Exist, Hitman, Origin, Wicked Little Letters, and more.  You can listen to The AwardsWatch Podcast wherever you stream podcasts, from iTunes, iHeartRadio, Soundcloud, Stitcher, Spotify, Audible, Amazon Music and more. This podcast runs 2h38m. We will be back next week to talk about our Top 5 Directorial Debuts, in honor of the stellar year of debuts that have come out in 2023. Till then, let’s get into it.

Pues eso es lo que aprenderás en este episodio 🤯 Mira. Una lista de email es un tesoro. Cada suscriptor es un cliente potencial en distintas fases de maduración. Y la lista de suscripción es el mecanismo que te asegura exposición y ventas a largo plazo, sin invertir en publicidad ni depender de algoritmos random. El valor de tu negocio es proporcional al tamaño de tu lista, así que una de las cosas más inteligentes que puedes hacer es perseguir registros o leads en lugar de perseguir clientes. En este episodio descubrirás un método deliciosamente sencillo (y tremendamente eficaz) para atraer suscriptores automáticamente. No es difícil de implementar y trabajará para ti indefinidamente. Nuestra invitada es María Jesús Molina: una científica que maneja el Marketing Digital con más soltura que muchos gurús del sector. ¡También lo explica mil veces mejor! Hace algunos años, María Jesús lanzó un proyecto de divulgación para acercar la ciencia a los niños. En menos de 1 año consiguió 13.000 suscriptores para su newsletter que es más de lo que consiguen la inmensa mayoría de negocios en toda su vida.

Mit Menschen, die in eine ausweglose Situation geraten und um ihr nacktes Überleben kämpfen, kann sich der Zuschauer schnell identifizieren. Filme wie ""Gravity"" oder ""Cast Away"" mit Sandra Bullock und Tom Hanks, aber auch Low-Budget-Produktionen wie ""Open Water"" haben das teils beeindruckend bewiesen.Der spanische Netflix-Film ""Nirgendwo"" schlägt exakt in diese Kerbe, will dabei aber - dem Zeitgeist angemessen - auch einen Film über eine starke Frau und Mutter erzählen. In naher Zukunft werden deswegen in Spanien aufgrund von Ressourcenknappheit vorwiegend Frauen und Kinder auf offener Straße erschossen. Auf der Flucht vor den Schergen, die natürlich allesamt nur aus bösen Männern bestehen, gerät die hochschwangere Mia (Anna Castillo) in eine Situation, die einen Überlebenskampf im Minutentakt fordert.Regisseur Albert Pintó hat nicht einmal im Ansatz Interesse an einer realistischen Geschichte. Mias Odyssee wirkt vom ersten Moment an wie ein sorgfältig konstruiertes Pseudo-Labyrinth. Auf jedes Problem folgt stehenden Fußes die Lösung. ""Nirgendwo"" ist ein filmisches Ärgernis, das bis zur letzten Sekunde künstlich, manipulierend und aufgesetzt daherkommt.Eine ausführliche Kritik zu ""Nirgendwo"" von Ronny Rüsch und Axel Max - jetzt in einer neuen Folge des ntv-Podcasts ""Oscars & Himbeeren"".

Entertainment Reporter Kevin McCarthy, and Fox 32 Chicago Entertainment Reporter Jake Hamilton. Sean and Kevin start off by talking about the Critics' Choice Awards, an event they were both able to attend (Jake was missed). From there, the show dives into the controversy swirling around a few current awards contenders, from James Franco of The Disaster Artist to the entirety of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Do bad headlines affect a movie or actor's awards chances? The boys discuss. Oh, then they play a really fun game where they take an actual Best Picture winner from the past 10 years and strip away its win, handing the Oscar to the movie that really SHOULD have won in that year.

0rtDVBcQdfopZ6HzmK5XdM,NLS 180: Man Meets ENTITIES Within His INSANE Psychedelic Out-Of-Body Experience (OBE) - Then WINS An Oscar! with Bruce Joel Rubin,2023-01-14,"At age five, Bruce Rubin had a spiritual experience playing in a sandbox in the middle of the afternoon. The sun disappeared, and a dense night sky appeared in its place. Infinite galaxies were swirling in the vastness of his own head, and he sensed the entire universe was contained within him.He knew instantly he was one with all there was. In the years that followed, Bruce became an Oscar-winning screenwriter, a spiritual teacher, and, most recently, a photographer. Each aspect of his life has been a conscious effort to explore and reveal what he learned in that sandbox.Bruce was born in the middle of WWII and raised in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Sondra and Jimmy Rubin. He has a younger brother and sister, Gary and Marci. There was very little remarkable about him. He wanted to be an actor, writer, and director but had no talent to speak of.In 1965 he took a massive (and accidental) overdose of LSD and began a journey that lasted between 3 and 4 billion years. When he returned, he knew he would have stories to tell. He also knew he needed to find a teacher, so he hitchhiked around the world for nearly two years in search of one.After living in ashrams in India and in a Tibetan monastery in Kathmandu, he met his teacher Rudi in New York City just blocks from where he had begun his journey. Rudi taught a meditation practice that became the foundation for Bruce’s spiritual life. He has meditated every day since. Bruce’s screenwriting career began late in his life. Earlier, he had been an assistant film editor for the NBC Nightly News and Curator and Head of the Film Department at the Whitney Museum in New York. When Rudi died, Bruce gave up his museum career to continue his spiritual practice with a disciple of Rudi’s in Bloomington, Indiana.While there, he was also writing movies, twice locking himself in a hotel room and refusing to emerge without a finished script. He also began teaching meditation to an expanding community of fellow seekers and continues holding classes to this day.After 44 years of daily meditation, Bruce experienced what is referred to as a spiritual awakening. For him, it was a revelation that no one could awaken. The illusion of a separate ego dissolved and left him in a state of extraordinary emptiness and inexplicable expansion. It was a profound step in a journey that began in a sandbox and continues to this moment.Bruce continues to share his evolving experience with his students. His talks can be found on YouTube and on his site. Recently, he also discovered photography as an unexpected opportunity for communicating his spiritual vision.The result of always having an iPhone in his pocket, he describes this new phase in his creative life as the discovery of seeing. As Bruce explains, “The mystery and magic of the world are not hidden. It is under our feet, on old walls, and in rusting garbage cans. The beauty, the wonder, never ends.”Please enjoy my conversation with Bruce Joel Rubin.This show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/4858435/advertisement",65.93,https://open.spotify.com/episode/0rtDVBcQdfopZ6HzmK5XdM,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['meditation'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-01-14

Anabella har inviteret Mette Oscar Pedersen ind til en snak om et aktivt og nysgerrigt liv. Mette lukker os ind i en verden hvor bevægelse, kærlighed og hjerte er flettet sammen i en harmonisk og livsbekræftende symfoni. Her, i det vakuum, hvor dans, spiritualitet og kærlighed kolliderer, finder vi ro i kaos, form i det formeløse og skønhed i det umiddelbare.Livet med dans er et liv i bevægelse, hvor hvert trin, hver gestus og hvert spring er en udtryksfuld fortælling. Det er ikke bare en fysisk aktivitet, men en mærkbar gestus af følelser og tanker, der skaber en dybere forbindelse til os selv og verden omkring os.

5ZYnxEYLxUMZbajT9202o1,Rozdali jsme politické Oscary. Boduje Černochová i Nekula,2023-06-26,"Kdo se stal politickým objevem sezony? A která letošní událost byla nejvíc překvapivá? To zhodnotí aktuální Šťastný podcast ve složení Jindřich Šídlo, Konstantin Sulimenko, Tereza Povolná a Ondřej Lasák.Už jen do úterý 27. června do 15:00 máte šanci se autorů Šťastného podcastu na cokoliv zeptat. Své otázky nám pošlete přes tento formulář. Promyšlené a erudované odpovědi uslyšíte ve speciální epizodě už 3. července.V závěru první sezony Šťastného podcastu jsme se chtěli ohlédnout za uplynulými deseti měsíci a ocenit ty nejlepší lidi i události, o kterých jsme v našem podcastu mluvili. Jak se ovšem ukázalo, vybrat v každé oskarové kategorii toho (či tu) úplně nejlepšího nebylo při tak obrovské konkurenci vůbec jednoduché. Třeba zvolit pouze jeden politický objev roku.„Ačkoliv vím, že se bude objevovat ještě v dalších kategoriích, musím nominovat Zdeňka Nekulu z KDU-ČSL,“ vybírá svého favorita, končícího ministra zemědělství, Jindřich Šídlo, „protože kdo z vás před rokem a půl, když byl Nekula jmenován ministrem, tušil, že z něj bude takový showman?“„Když se na celou sezónu podívám analyticky, pak, i když se mi to vůbec nelíbí, je pro mě jasný vítěz Jindřich Rajchl,“ krčí rameny Ondřej Lasák a neustupuje ani po argumentu, že má Rajchl v průzkumech sotva dvě procenta.„Můj nominant na objev roku nebude člověk, ale agentura Star Research. To je ta agentura, která neexistuje a jejíž průzkum si vylepil Tomio Okamura před prezidentskými volbami na svůj Facebook, protože v něm měl Bašta asi 18 %. Pamatuju si, že tím číslem pak argumentoval v televizních pořadech, dokud se ho Terezie Tománková nezeptala, jestli nevadí, že ta agentura neexistuje,“ připomíná Tereza Povolná kauzu ze začátku roku.Komu jsme nakonec cenu za politický objev roku přisoudili? Dozvíte se v podcastu.Kategorií bylo ale samozřejmě mnohem více. Vyhlašovali jsme politika sezony (nepřekvapivým vítězem se stal Petr Pavel), političku sezony (nepřekvapivou vítězkou se stala Jana Černochová), nejsmutnější událost sezony nebo třeba největší překvapení sezony.„K této kategorii jsem si dovolil udělat několik nominací já,“ říká Konstantin Sulimenko, „prvními nominovanými jsou Piráti za to, že stále neodešli ani nebyli vyhozeni z vlády. Druhým adeptem je schodek státního rozpočtu za to, že ani v červnu stále nepřesáhl hranici 500 miliard. A posledním, kdo má šanci v této kategorii zvítězit, jsou korunovační klenoty za to, že ani po konci úřadování Vratislava Mynáře na Hradě nezmizely.“Co nakonec bylo tím největším letošním politickým překvapením? Které politické přátelství bylo letos to nejkrásnější? A stal se Petr Fiala předsedou vlády sezony, nebo mu i toto ocenění někdo ukradl?

Men lige så sikker han var, da han gik, lige så meget fortrød han det tre måneder senere. For hvem var han egentlig, hvis han ikke var den gode, loyale kæreste, der troede på for evigt? I dagens afsnit fortæller model og DJ Oscar Bjerrehuus, hvad der skete, siden han lukkede danskerne ind i sit liv i DR serien “Mere voksen end Bjerrehuus”  i sæson 1, hvor han drømte om den store kærlighed med sin kæreste, og på alle måder gerne ville distancere sig fra sin fars mere rodede livsstil. I sæson to har Oscar nemlig slået op med kæresten og er nu lige så single som sin far. Oscar fortæller om at tvivle og fortryde, græde alene om natten og prøve at finde ud af, hvem man i virkeligheden er - og for hvis skyld, man er det. Om til sidst at lykkedes med at blive venner med sin eks efter først at have forsøgt og mislykkedes - og om at finde mening i, hvad det i virkeligheden er, man skal i det her liv. Oscar gør selvfølgelig også sit allerbedste for at hjælpe dig, der sidder med hjertesorg lige nu. Den her podcast er til dig, der har prøvet at være forelsket. Dig, der engang har haft kærestesorg.

Cada suscriptor tiene un valor monetario real porque eventualmente puede convertirse en un cliente. Y si sabes cómo comprar suscriptores por debajo de ese precio, básicamente tienes una máquina de imprimir dinero 🤑 Odio ese tipo de frases y seguro que tú también... Pero te voy a explicar por qué es así. Mira, imagina que puedes comprar 100 suscriptores por 200€. En los próximos 12 meses uno de esos suscriptores te compra un taller de 97€, otro un curso de 347€ y otro te contrata una consultoría de 600€. En total has invertido 200€ en conseguir esos 100 suscriptores y te han acabado generado 1.044€. Has obtenido 5,22 veces más de lo que has metido. Lo que te decía: una máquina de fabricar dinero 💰 Pero cuidado. ¿Dónde compras esos suscriptores? ¿Y cómo lo haces para no perder hasta la camisa? Para resolver estas cuestiones hablé con Emma Llensa.

Mal statt. Am 26. Februar 2017 gingen in Los Angeles (und analog weltweit) manche Mundwinkel nach oben und unten sowie Handflächen klatschend zusammen. Der klare Favorit war mit 14 Nominierungen das Musical „La La Land“, was gleichzeitig Rekord bedeutete. Doch mit dem afro-amerikanischen Drama „Moonlight“, der auf beachtliche 8 Nominierungen kam, hatte Damien Chazelle Liebeserklärung an Hollywood  einen äußerst ernst zu nehmenden Konkurrenten. Dagegen überraschten die 8 Nominierungen für das Sci-Fi/Drama „Arrival“ weitgehend die Fachwelt. Weitere aussichtsreiche Kandidaten waren die jeweils für 6 Goldmänner nominierten Filme „Hacksaw Ridge“ und „Lion“.  Wie bereits letztes Jahr möchten wir auch diesmal gemeinsam unsere Eindrücke zu der wichtigsten Award-Show des Planeten mittels Podcast loswerden. So nehmen Podgast Micha, Tom und Florian den erreignisreichen Abend voller Preise, Promis und Pannen unter die Lupe, sprechen über Sieger und Verlierer und wem sie ganz persönlich die Daumen gedrückt haben.

5ja3jmmquQqsE0DAJSZ9aV,10 - El autismo desde los ojos de un niño: entrevista a Óscar Villela,2022-12-18,"Vivimos en una sociedad extremadamente adultocentrista. Durante años se ha invisibilizado las necesidades propias de niñas, niños y adolescentes. De hecho, muchos niños son tratados simplemente como adultos en miniatura: que si debe permanecer sentado en la mesa “sin molestar”, que si no debe llorar o incluso, que no tengan rabietas, son algunas de las cuestiones absurdas que se les ha exigido a los niños. Afortunadamente, cada vez estas prácticas están disminuyendo, aunque cuando se trata de infancias autistas, aún los adultos tenemos mucho trabajo por delante para reconocerles su voz e identidad individual. ¿Por qué crees que te estoy hablando de esto? Porque precisamente en el podcast de hoy no será un adulto el que hable. Por primera vez en el podcast de Autismo en Positivo, voy a entrevistar a un niño. Él es Óscar Villela y respetando el derecho a la privacidad de su imagen, esta vez no podrás ver el rostro de mi invitado, pero sí podrás escuchar directamente de su voz, las respuestas a muchas de las inquietudes que surgieron en esta conversación. Te aviso que esta entrevista te puede abrumar. No solo por la sinceridad aplastante de Óscar, sino porque puso en palabras lo que muchos niños autistas sienten. Si alguna vez te has preguntado cómo vive su día a día un niño dentro del espectro, pues quédate escuchando hasta el final. No quiero dar inicio al podcast sin antes darle gracias no solo a Óscar sino a sus padres, Oscar y Mimí, por su generosidad y enorme contribución a la divulgación del autismo, labor que ayuda a romper estigmas y prejuicios. También te recuerdo que si este podcast te resulta interesante, déjame una reseña bien sea en Spotify, Apple Podcast o Youtube. No te tomará mucho tiempo y para mí, significa muchísimo.  --------------------- Para hacer mis formaciones o reservar una asesoría personalizada, dirígete a mi web: www.autismoenpositivo.es Próxima formación: BOOTCAMO AUTISMO 360 EN MADRID https://www.integracionsensorial.org/producto/bootcamp-madrid/  Sígueme en mis redes sociales: Instagram: www.instagram.com/autismoenpositivo_ Facebook: www.facebook.com/autismoenpositivospain Twitter: www.twitter.com/autismoenpositi TikTok: @autismoenpositivo ",50.85,https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ja3jmmquQqsE0DAJSZ9aV,['es'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['prejuicios'],[],[],[],"['adult', 'adulto']","['nina', 'nino']",['man'],[],2022-12-18

E como a noite de 27 de março de 2022 vai entrar para a história, o que não falta é assunto! Prêmios vencedores, audiência, Beyoncé, justiças e injustiças, o prêmio principal da noite, e claro: um certo tapa na cara dado durante a audiência. Rafael Arinelli, Daniel Cury, Thamires Viana (Cineclick) e Edu Sacer (Loggado) conversam sobre a tal da “audiência do público jovem”, a falta de valorização do próprio cinema por parte da Academia, já que homenageia os honorários em outro momento e edita as premiações menores. Tem também aquele papo cheio de brincadeiras e bom humor (depois de ânimos exaltados) sobre o chamado “Oscar Fan Favorite” e “Cheer Moment”, e como “No Ritmo do Coração” tem relação com o momento em que vivemos e a conexão do Oscar com audiências mais amplas (independentemente do quanto é “justo” o filme ganhar). Além disso, é claro que sobra espaço para discutir toda a treta Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith e Chris Rock.
