2023-12-03,"Various devastating infection outbreaks including COVID-19, threat both mother and fetus health. These life-threating outbreaks as potential harms are highly associated with relevant perceived risk. Social support and mindfulness are two factors that may moderate the associations between the perceived risk of COVID-19 and pregnancy outcomes. In this study we investigated the potential moderating impact of social support and mindfulness in the aforementioned association. This study is a longitudinal cohort study in which 483 Iranian pregnant women in Tehran have been studied. Perceived risk of COVID-19 questions, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) were used through an online platform to assess the independent variables during pregnancy. Neonatal and maternal outcomes including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, abortion, birth weight, and gestational age at birth, was extracted from Electronic Health Record (EHR) after childbirth as the dependent variables. The aim of the study is to investigate whether social support and mindfulness can affect the associations between perceived risk of Covid-19 acquisition and pregnancy outcomes. Perceived risk of COVID-19 was negatively associated with pregnancy outcomes including birth weight (-28, 95% CI [-53, -3.4], p < .05) and gestational age at birth (-0.9, 95% CI [-2,0.11], p < .05). However, social support could not moderate these associations. Mindfulness, on the other hand, moderated the association between perceived risk and stillbirth meaning that by increasing mindfulness, the association between the perceived risk and stillbirth may also be increased (OR = 0.03; p < .05). The findings of this study showed that social support lacks the moderating impact on the association between perceived risk of COVID-19 and pregnancy outcomes. Mindfulness, on the other hand, indicate a positive moderating impact for the association between perceived risk of Covid-19 and stillbirth.

This research has shed light on the potential benefits and drawbacks of digital technologies for mental health and well-being. However, the intricate relationship between technology and psychology remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the impact of mindfulness-based mobile apps on university students' anxiety, loneliness, and well-being. Additionally, it sought to explore participants' perceptions of the addictiveness of these apps. The research utilized a multi-phase approach, encompassing a correlational research method, a pretest–posttest randomized controlled trial, and a qualitative case study. Participants were segmented into three subsets: correlations (n = 300), treatment (n = 60), and qualitative (n = 20). Data were gathered from various sources, including the social anxiety scale, well-being scale, social media use integration scale, and an interview checklist. Quantitative data was analyzed using Pearson correlation, multiple regression, and t-tests, while qualitative data underwent thematic analysis. The study uncovered a significant correlation between social media use and the variables under investigation. Moreover, the treatment involving mindfulness-based mobile apps led to a reduction in students' anxiety and an enhancement of their well-being. Notably, participants held various positive perceptions regarding the use of these apps. The findings of this research hold both theoretical and practical significance for the field of digital psychology. They provide insight into the potential of mindfulness-based mobile apps to positively impact university students' mental health and well-being. Additionally, the study underscores the need for further exploration of the intricate dynamics between technology and psychology in an increasingly digital world.","Social media usage and students' social anxiety, loneliness and well ...",https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-023-01398-7,en,BMC Psychology,"['Sun', 'School Of Marxism', 'Zhoukou Vocational', 'Technical College', 'Zhoukou', 'Li Sun', 'You Can Also Search For This Author In', 'Author Information', 'Corresponding Author', 'Correspondence To']","SAS-A assesses various aspects of social anxiety, including fear of negative evaluation, social avoidance and distress, and physiological symptoms such as sweating and blushing.
