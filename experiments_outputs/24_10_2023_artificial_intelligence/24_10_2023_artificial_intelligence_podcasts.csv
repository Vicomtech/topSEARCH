0qkK5lNuRFJq0o11Js5Hvl,"Marc Andreessen: How Risk Taking, Innovation & Artificial Intelligence Transform Human Experience",2023-09-04,"In this episode, my guest is Marc Andreessen, the legendary software innovator who co-created the internet browser Mosaic, co-founded Netscape, and is now at Andreessen Horowitz — a venture capital firm that finds and brings to life technologies that transform humanity. We discuss what it takes to be a true innovator, including the personality traits required, the role of environment and the support systems needed to bring revolutionary ideas to fruition. We discuss risk-taking as a necessary but potentially hazardous trait, as well as the role of intrinsic motivation and one’s ability to navigate uncertainty. We also discuss artificial intelligence (AI) and Marc’s stance that soon everyone will use AI as their personalized coach and guide for making decisions about their health, relationships, finances and more — all of which he believes will greatly enhance our quality of life. We also delve into nuclear power, gene editing, public trust, universities, politics, and AI regulation.

That hasn't happened - but will it?  To get to the bottom of this, I talked with Matthew Lungren, MD, Chief Medical Information Officer at Nuance Communications, a Microsoft company applying AI to healthcare workflows, and the name that comes at the top of the list when you look up #radiology and #AI. He also has a pediatric radiology practice at UCSF  and previously led the Stanford [University] Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging. More recently he served as Principal for Clinical AI/ML at Amazon Web Services in World Wide Public Sector Healthcare. He has an impressive oeuvre of over 100 publications, including work on multi-modal data fusion models for healthcare applications, and new computer vision and natural language processing approaches for healthcare-specific domains. The basis for Hinton's assertion was that AI can be trained to find tumors, for instance, in CT scans, and we know how good AI is at image analysis when it’s got lots of labeled data to be trained on, and we certainly have that with CT scans.  We get to find out what's real about AI in #medicine in this episode.

It is essential to continuously monitor model performance and promptly retrain them with fresh data to adapt. Implementing strategies like MLOps and automation can track changes efficiently, and visual monitoring is helpful for detecting deviations. Highlighting the significance of diversified training datasets, the need for updates and retraining to mitigate the risk of drift is emphasized, ultimately leading to a more resilient and adaptable machine learning model, thus ensuring longevity and usefulness.  ---   Send in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/tonyphoang/message Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/tonyphoang/support",14.94,https://open.spotify.com/episode/1IgaVhmmtN9CBrgOiLT3Uf,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-10-04

Sara also highlights the impact and the emotional connection that language models have created in society, the benefits and the current safety concerns of universal models, and the significance of having grounded conversations to characterize and mitigate the risk and development of AI models. Along the way, we also dive deep into Cohere and Cohere for AI, along with their Aya project, an open science project that aims to build a state-of-the-art multilingual generative language model as well as some of their recent research papers.

1UgKZXA37MFnaP8UBwPC5U,118: Artificial Intelligence Out of Control: The Apocalypse is Here | How AI and ChatGPT End Humanity,2023-07-07,"The story of humans began a long time ago. Three and a half billion years ago protein molecules floated around the ooze called the primordial soup. Then something happened and a molecule made a copy of itself. And then another copy and another. Soon these molecules arranged themselves into something called a cell. Then cells clumped together and multiplied. Organisms were created. Over the next three billion years, the organisms became more complicated and more diverse. 375 million years ago one of those organisms crawled out of the sea. 4 million years ago hominids emerged. Hominids had large brains and advanced cognitive abilities. They could reason, communicate and cooperate. 200,000 years ago, homo sapiens, modern humans appeared. They developed agriculture, organized into civilizations and became masters of the planet. The story of humans began a long time ago. But all stories end. And according to many leaders in business, science and technology: we're in the final chapter. The part of our story where we finally go extinct.

We discuss the issues that can arise from inconsistencies in generative AI models, how he tested ChatGPT’s performance in various tasks, drawing comparisons between March 2023 and June 2023 for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 versions, and the possible reasons behind the declining performance of these models. James also shared his thoughts on how surgical AI editing akin to CRISPR could potentially revolutionize LLM and AI systems, and how adding monitoring tools can help in tracking behavioral changes in these models. Finally, we discuss James' recent paper on pathology image analysis using Twitter data, in which he explores the challenges of obtaining large medical datasets and data collection, as well as detailing the model’s architecture, training, and the evaluation process.

In our conversation with Nataniel, we discuss his recent work around personalization for text-to-image AI models. Specifically, we dig into DreamBooth, an algorithm that enables “subject-driven generation,” that is, the creation of personalized generative models using a small set of user-provided images about a subject. The personalized models can then be used to generate the subject in various contexts using a text prompt. Nataniel gives us a dive deep into the fine-tuning approach used in DreamBooth, the potential reasons behind the algorithm’s effectiveness, the challenges of fine-tuning diffusion models in this way, such as language drift, and how the prior preservation loss technique avoids this setback, as well as the evaluation challenges and metrics used in DreamBooth. We also touched base on his other recent papers including SuTI, StyleDrop, HyperDreamBooth, and lastly, Platypus.

Each episode weaves together original analysis, critical perspective, and novel thought experiments with some of the most compelling exchanges from the Making Sense archive. Whether you are new to a particular topic, or think you have your mind made up about it, we think you’ll find this series fascinating. In this episode, we explore the landscape of Artificial Intelligence. We’ll listen in on Sam’s conversation with decision theorist and artificial-intelligence researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, as we consider the potential dangers of AI – including the control problem and the value-alignment problem – as well as the concepts of Artificial General Intelligence, Narrow Artificial Intelligence, and Artificial Super Intelligence. We’ll then be introduced to philosopher Nick Bostrom’s “Genies, Sovereigns, Oracles, and Tools,” as physicist Max Tegmark outlines just how careful we need to be as we travel down the AI path. Computer scientist Stuart Russell will then dig deeper into the value-alignment problem and explain its importance.   We’ll hear from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt about the geopolitical realities of AI terrorism and weaponization. We’ll then touch the topic of consciousness as Sam and psychologist Paul Bloom turn the conversation to the ethical and psychological complexities of living alongside humanlike AI. Psychologist Alison Gopnik then reframes the general concept of intelligence to help us wonder if the kinds of systems we’re building using “Deep Learning” are really marching us towards our super-intelligent overlords.   Finally, physicist David Deutsch will argue that many value-alignment fears about AI are based on a fundamental misunderstanding about how knowledge actually grows in this universe.  ",67.87,https://open.spotify.com/episode/4glvyaJM5CQTcvtFim2bFQ,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2022-11-22

Farmwave founder and CEO Craig Ganssle is my guest today. Craig first appeared on the show back in episode 237 in late 2020, where we talked a lot about Craig’s military and technology background and how he has applied it in agriculture. Today, we focus on creating real value for farmer customers, the role of artificial intelligence, and the journey of a successful agtech entrepreneur. If you’re still a little fuzzy on what Farmwave does, the most succinct way to sum it up is to say that they’ve built an autonomous harvest loss system that uses cameras and vision based AI to detect harvest loss in real time and deliver those results in the cab in real time without ever having to stop. Craig first discovered artificial intelligence while serving in the United States Marine Corps as an intelligence communications operator with the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). He was later honorably discharged in 2001 for medical reasons. Craig then spent 15 years as a senior engineer with Verizon Wireless prior to founding Farmwave.Craig is so open about his journey and the lessons he has learned along the way, so all of you who are trying to build or operate a business in agriculture will be able to pull something valuable from this episode.",39.7,https://open.spotify.com/episode/2E3f4m9CNHGYFX4b5CxadL,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['liver'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-10-04

He received a PhD from Stanford, was a tenured professor at California State University, and has been awarded over 300 patents. He's currently CEO and Chief Scientist of Unanimous AI, a company that amplifies human group intelligence using AI technology based on the biological principle of Swarm Intelligence, which is where the bees come in. The UNU Swarm Intelligence that he created has an extraordinary record of making predictions like Oscar winners. We talk about how AI can help humans cooperate instead of conflict, and we talk about threats to privacy, and the convergence of AI and AR/VR technology like Apple's new headset. All this plus our usual look at today's AI headlines.

04vBCsMcy19qGO5fAMtybN,Can we control Artificial Intelligence?,2023-04-07,"Last month a company in San Francisco called OpenAi released an artificial intelligence system called GPT-4 - a successor to its hugely popular AI chatbot ChatGPT. The latest version can respond to images, write captions and descriptions - processing up to 25,000 words at a time. Researchers claim GPT-4 shows  “sparks of artificial general intelligence” - in other words it can match or exceed human capabilities in tasks a person can do.  But there are concerns this latest technology could be used to spread disinformation alongside worries over privacy, jobs and even society itself if more rules aren’t quickly introduced. Key figures in the tech industry - including Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, and Apple’s co-founder Steve Wozniak - have signed an open letter asking for a pause on “giant AI experiments” so that policymakers can catch up.   There are potentially wide-ranging benefits to these advances. In recently published guidance on the responsible use of AI, the UK government described it as one of the ""technologies of tomorrow” contributing £3.7bn ($5.6bn) to the UK economy last year alone.   So what might the social impact of these increasingly powerful AI systems be? If greater regulation is needed, who is responsible? And, if we don’t control it, is there a chance that one day these machines will outsmart and replace us?

0xe9NX1FZnORwNJ2CAmlkU,Special series: Artificial intelligence application for urologic cancer detection and classification,2023-10-07,"In 'Episode 4' of the special podcast series on ""Uro-oncologic surgery driven by new technologies"", Prof. Ricardo Autorino (IT) talks to expert Assoc. Prof. Giovanni Enrico Cacciamani (US) about Artificial intelligence application for urologic cancer detection and classification.Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionised urologic cancer detection by leveraging principles from computer science, machine learning and deep learning. In this context, AI serves as a powerful tool to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and treatment.Assoc. Prof. Cacciamani shares his knowledge how computer science forms the foundation of AI algorithms, enabling the processing and analysis of vast datasets, including medical images and patient records. Machine learning techniques, a subset of AI, are applied to these datasets to create predictive models that can identify patterns and anomalies within patient data. Deep learning, a specialised branch of machine learning, excels in image recognition tasks and has been instrumental in the interpretation of medical images like CT scans, MRI scans, and histopathological slides.By implementing AI in urologic cancer detection, healthcare professionals can achieve faster and more accurate diagnosis, early cancer detection, and personalised treatment recommendations. AI systems can assist in the identification of tumours, tracking their growth over time, and predicting patient outcomes. This integration of AI technologies enhances the quality of patient care, potentially leading to better survival rates and improved overall well-being for individuals with urologic cancers.This podcast was produced in collaboration with the YAU Urotechnology group.",22.64,https://open.spotify.com/episode/0xe9NX1FZnORwNJ2CAmlkU,['en-GB'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-10-07

06JYpYYbdl6tlJHExZr8K5,Can Artificial Intelligence teach itself?,2023-06-09,"Welcome to the exciting new field of generative artificial intelligence - or generative AI. We’re not talking about robots or spaceships: instead these are image generators and chatbots that are already revolutionising the way people write, research and interact in the virtual world. Their capabilities are extraordinary. But before they can produce results they first need to be trained on vast amounts of data. And that’s what got CrowdScience listener Ian wondering. He says: “Before long, much of the material on the internet will have been written, or at least co-written, by AIs. What will happen when AIs are being trained on texts they have written themselves?”   To answer this question Anand Jagatia first meets artist and scientist Michelle Huang. Michelle recently embarked on a therapy project to try and connect with her own “inner child”. She took a decade’s worth of her diaries from her childhood and fed them into an AI to try and simulate a conversation between her and her younger self. Can a machine convincingly recreate the voice of a human being? You can be the judge!   Then, data scientist Briana Brownell joins Anand to explain a little about how ‘generative AI’ like this actually works. Together they open up the popular chatbot, ChatGPT, to put it to the test: but can it help Anand solve his personal conundrum?   Now that we understand what AI is capable of we also need to know its limits. AI researcher Pablo Villalobos describes the process of training generative AI and where it gets its material from. The amount of data consumed in this way keeps going up and up, Pablo and his colleagues have been calculating exactly when that data is likely to run out. Pablo also discusses recent research exploring a unique effect that occurs if AI is repeatedly trained on its own material. Finally, Briana Brownell returns to cover a range of wider issues related to artificial intelligence and what effects it might have on our future.

On one hand, it is among the poorest countries in the world and on the other hand, it is, to me at least, one of the most forward-thinking nations on the globe. Actually, when you think about it, the lack of resources perhaps creates the innovation. Let’s look back at what’s been done so far. Rwanda partnered with an American startup, Zipline, to deliver lifesaving drugs to rural health centers by drone. Then it partnered with Starlink, Elon Musk’s company, to provide high speed internet to rural schools. The country, made up of citizens that earn an average of a thousand dollars a year, has still found the means to launch satellites into space, and found coding academies. How is this possible? What are the driving forces behind it? What are the tangible benefits? What are the risks involved? And what does Rwanda look like, technologically speaking, in the next couple of years and decades? And how does Rwanda’s Artificial Intelligence policy fit into all of this?To answer these questions, I am joined on the Long Form podcast this week by Paula Ingabire,  Rwanda's Minister of ICT and InnovationIf you want to share your thoughts on the topics I discuss use the hashtag #LongFormRw on Twitter and follow us on Twitter and Instagram on our handle @TheLongFormRwBe a part of the conversation.

The fascination with machines mimicking human cognition has ancient roots, with modern AI birthed in the 1956 Dartmouth Workshop.   While traditional AI excels in specific tasks, AGI promises adaptability across various tasks and can collaborate with humans in diverse fields.   AGI's emergence is driven by technological advancements, but its exact development and deployment paths are uncertain.   Key challenges include ethical dilemmas like transparency and fairness, technical hurdles like safety and robustness, and societal impacts such as job displacement.   Potential dangers of AGI include amplifying misinformation, weaponization, and economic disruptions.   Over-reliance on AGI can lead to skill loss, and its environmental demands necessitate sustainable solutions.   Various tests, from the Turing Test to the Coffee Test, measure AGI's capabilities.   The journey to AGI reflects human curiosity, innovation, and the need for caution and foresight.

0onlMQhcSWoxdHERBTk9xW,Babbage: Is GPT-4 the dawn of true artificial intelligence?,2023-03-22,"OpenAI's ChatGPT, an advanced chatbot, has taken the world by storm, amassing over 100 million monthly active users and exhibiting unprecedented capabilities. From crafting essays and fiction to designing websites and writing code, you’d be forgiven for thinking there’s little it can’t do. Now it’s had an upgrade. GPT-4 has even more incredible abilities, it can take in photos as an input, and deliver smoother, more natural writing to the user. But it also hallucinates, throws up false answers, and remains unable to reference any world events that happened after September 2021.Seeking to get under the hood of the Large Language Model that operates GPT-4, host Alok Jha speaks with Maria Laikata, a professor in Natural Language Processing at Queen Mary University of London. We put the technology through its paces with The Economist’s tech-guru Ludwig Seigele, and even run it through something like a Turing Test to give an idea of whether it could pass for human-level-intelligence. An Artificial General Intelligence is the ultimate goal of AI research, so how significant will GPT-4 and similar technologies be in the grand scheme of machine intelligence? Not very, suggests Gary Marcus, expert in both AI and human intelligence, though they will impact all of our lives both in good and bad ways. For full access to The Economist’s print, digital and audio editions subscribe at economist.com/podcastoffer and sign up for our weekly science newsletter at economist.com/simplyscience.",43.37,https://open.spotify.com/episode/0onlMQhcSWoxdHERBTk9xW,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['liver'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-03-22

And we’re beginning to see the first glimmers of some kind of artificial intelligence: computer programs have become much better than humans at well-defined jobs like playing chess and Go, and are increasingly called upon for messier tasks, like driving cars. Once we leave the highly constrained sphere of artificial games and enter the real world of human actions, our artificial intelligences are going to have to make choices about the best course of action in unclear circumstances: they will have to learn to be ethical. I talk to Derek Leben about what this might mean and what kind of ethics our computers should be taught.

7yLKkICrZorveRjRe3yGIp,Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Programmatic Advertising,2017-08-06,"A huge percentage of digital advertising dollars today go to Google and Facebook, who dominate that sector - and are inevitably central for the future of programmatic advertising. There’s a lot of evidence to suggest that the growth in digital advertising in the last two to three years has gone almost entirely into their coffers. At least for the foreseeable future, Facebook and Google will retain the ability to dominate that space. The ability to be able to bid for the attention of particular target audiences, whether they’re searching for a specific term, live in a specific place or they like a specific sports team, is something that doesn’t seem to be going away, and seems to be rather efficient, thanks in the large part to Artificial Intelligence. In this episode we talk to Lior Tasman who is the CEO of PredictiveBid, an Israeli-based predictive advertising optimization start-up. The team focuses on applying AI to some of the bigger issues in programmatic advertising to help draw out more ROI from ads. We discuss some of the challenges of programmatic advertising and what the future of programmatic advertising may look like from an advertiser’s perspective.

You'll find out from Louis Rosenberg on this episode. He's been working in AR and VR starting over 30 years ago at Stanford and NASA. 1992 he developed the first mixed reality system at Air Force Research Laboratory. In 2004 he founded the early AR company Outland Research which was acquired by Google in 2011. He received a PhD from Stanford, was a tenured professor at California State University, and has been awarded over 300 patents. He's currently CEO and Chief Scientist of Unanimous AI, a company that amplifies human group intelligence using AI technology based on the biological principle of Swarm Intelligence, which is where the bees come in. The Swarm AI technology that he created has an extraordinary record of making predictions like Oscar winners.

2tKCq3GBV0pETMAEA35ZHJ,"Marc Andreessen: How Risk Taking, Innovation & Artificial Intelligence Transform Human Experience",2023-09-04,"   In this episode, my guest is Marc Andreessen, the legendary software innovator who co-created the internet browser Mosaic, co-founded Netscape, and is now at Andreessen Horowitz — a venture capital firm that finds and brings to life technologies that transform humanity. We discuss what it takes to be a true innovator, including the personality traits required, the role of environment and the support systems needed to bring revolutionary ideas to fruition. We discuss risk-taking as a necessary but potentially hazardous trait, as well as the role of intrinsic motivation and one’s ability to navigate uncertainty. We also discuss artificial intelligence (AI) and Marc’s stance that soon everyone will use AI as their personalized coach and guide for making decisions about their health, relationships, finances and more — all of which he believes will greatly enhance our quality of life. We also delve into nuclear power, gene editing, public trust, universities, politics, and AI regulation.

Flanagan offers the customers the experience of personalized drink recommendations while simultaneously collecting more data about their preferences. It’s a win-win that enhances customer connection, and ultimately, customer loyalty. Ana talks with Ben about these types of practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and we explore other opportunities for businesses to leverage the tech to best meet their customers’ needs.

4VB3vTMEcrxycKARyIBu43,Five: Chris Olah on what the hell is going on inside neural networks,2023-09-02,"Originally released in August 2021. Chris Olah has had a fascinating and unconventional career path. Most people who want to pursue a research career feel they need a degree to get taken seriously. But Chris not only doesn't have a PhD, but doesn’t even have an undergraduate degree. After dropping out of university to help defend an acquaintance who was facing bogus criminal charges, Chris started independently working on machine learning research, and eventually got an internship at Google Brain, a leading AI research group. In this interview — a follow-up to our episode on his technical work — we discuss what, if anything, can be learned from his unusual career path. Should more people pass on university and just throw themselves at solving a problem they care about? Or would it be foolhardy for others to try to copy a unique case like Chris’?Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.We also cover some of Chris' personal passions over the years, including his attempts to reduce what he calls 'research debt' by starting a new academic journal called Distill, focused just on explaining existing results unusually clearly.As Chris explains, as fields develop they accumulate huge bodies of knowledge that researchers are meant to be familiar with before they start contributing themselves. But the weight of that existing knowledge — and the need to keep up with what everyone else is doing — can become crushing. It can take someone until their 30s or later to earn their stripes, and sometimes a field will split in two just to make it possible for anyone to stay on top of it.If that were unavoidable it would be one thing, but Chris thinks we're nowhere near communicating existing knowledge as well as we could. Incrementally improving an explanation of a technical idea might take a single author weeks to do, but could go on to save a day for thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of students, if it becomes the best option available.Despite that, academics have little incentive to produce outstanding explanations of complex ideas that can speed up the education of everyone coming up in their field. And some even see the process of deciphering bad explanations as a desirable right of passage all should pass through, just as they did.So Chris tried his hand at chipping away at this problem — but concluded the nature of the problem wasn't quite what he originally thought. In this conversation we talk about that, as well as:• Why highly thoughtful cold emails can be surprisingly effective, but average cold emails do little• Strategies for growing as a researcher• Thinking about research as a market• How Chris thinks about writing outstanding explanations• The concept of 'micromarriages' and ‘microbestfriendships’• And much more.Get this episode by subscribing to our podcast on the world’s most pressing problems and how to solve them: type 80,000 Hours into your podcasting app.Producer: Keiran HarrisAudio mastering: Ben CordellTranscriptions: Sofia Davis-Fogel",189.34,https://open.spotify.com/episode/4VB3vTMEcrxycKARyIBu43,['en-AU'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2023-09-02

3FOZWxG3wlWtaqqtDNvcvU,China’s Approach to Artificial Intelligence: A Conversation with Gregory C. Allen,2023-05-24,"In this episode of the ChinaPower Podcast, we are joined by Mr. Gregory C. Allen to discuss artificial intelligence (AI), China’s thinking on AI technology, and U.S.-China competition in this realm. Mr. Allen explains that over the last decade, the approach to AI technology has greatly shifted with a new emphasis on machine learning. He describes the steps of the AI value chain and how different stages are more computationally intensive than others. He assesses that China has responded to U.S. export controls on certain advanced computing chips to China through several measures, including foreign technology acquisition and restriction evasion. However, Mr. Allen points out that chip making equipment is central to AI technology, and China does not yet possess this capability. Lastly, he reveals that the Chinese military views AI capabilities as foundational to China’s economic and military power.  Gregory C. Allen is the director of the Wadhwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies and a senior fellow in the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Prior to joining CSIS, he was the director of strategy and policy at the Department of Defense (DOD) Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where he oversaw development and implementation of the DOD’s AI Strategy, drove policy and human capital reforms to accelerate the DOD’s adoption of AI, developed mechanisms for AI governance and ethics, and led frequent diplomatic engagements with governments and militaries in Europe and the Indo-Pacific regions, including China.",42.05,https://open.spotify.com/episode/3FOZWxG3wlWtaqqtDNvcvU,['en-US'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-05-24

Get ready to challenge your perspectives as we sit down with Andrew Ng. We navigate the widely disputed topic of AI as a potential existential threat, with Andrew assuring us that, with time and global cooperation, safety measures can be built to prevent disaster.   He offers insight into the debates surrounding the harm AI might cause, including the notions of AI as a bio-weapon and the notorious ‘paper clip argument’. Listen as Andrew debunks these theories, delivering an interesting argument for why he believes the associated risks are minimal.Onwards, we venture into the intriguing realm of AI’s capability to understand the world, setting the stage for a conversation on how we can objectively assess their comprehension.  We explore the safety measures of AI, drawing parallels with the rigour of the aviation industry, and contemplate on the consensus within the research community regarding the danger posed by AI.

And make sure to stick around for the end of each episode, where we provide our list of recommendations from the worlds of film, television, literature, music, and art.   In this episode, we explore the landscape of Artificial Intelligence. We’ll listen in on Sam’s conversation with decision theorist and artificial-intelligence researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, as we consider the potential dangers of AI — including the control problem and the value-alignment problem — as well as the concepts of Artificial General Intelligence, Narrow Artificial Intelligence, and Artificial Super Intelligence. We’ll then be introduced to philosopher Nick Bostrom’s “Genies, Sovereigns, Oracles, and Tools,” as physicist Max Tegmark outlines just how careful we need to be as we travel down the AI path. Computer scientist Stuart Russell will then dig deeper into the value-alignment problem and explain its importance. We’ll hear from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt about the geopolitical realities of AI terrorism and weaponization. We’ll then touch the topic of consciousness as Sam and psychologist Paul Bloom turn the conversation to the ethical and psychological complexities of living alongside humanlike AI. Psychologist Alison Gopnik then reframes the general concept of intelligence to help us wonder if the kinds of systems we’re building using “Deep Learning” are really marching us towards our super-intelligent overlords.

A simple way to think about the discrepancy is through the lens of “common sense” — there are features of the world, from the fact that tables are solid to the prediction that a tree won’t walk across the street, that humans take for granted but that machines have difficulty learning. Melanie Mitchell is a computer scientist and complexity researcher who has written a new book about the prospects of modern AI. We talk about deep learning and other AI strategies, why they currently fall short at equipping computers with a functional “folk physics” understanding of the world, and how we might move forward.Support Mindscape on Patreon.Melanie Mitchell received her Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Michigan. She is currently a professor of computer science at Portland State University and an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute.

2e7KpEw40ld29IXHwU822q,"Daniel Schmachtenberger: ""Artificial Intelligence and The Superorganism""",2023-05-17,"On this episode, Daniel Schmachtenberger returns to discuss a surprisingly overlooked risk to our global systems and planetary stability: artificial intelligence. Through a systems perspective, Daniel and Nate piece together the biophysical history that has led humans to this point, heading towards (and beyond) numerous planetary boundaries and facing geopolitical risks all with existential consequences. How does artificial intelligence, not only add to these risks, but accelerate the entire dynamic of the metacrisis? What is the role of intelligence vs wisdom on our current global pathway, and can we change course? Does artificial intelligence have a role to play in creating a more stable system or will it be the tipping point that drives our current one out of control?  About Daniel Schmachtenberger: Daniel Schmachtenberger is a founding member of The Consilience Project, aimed at improving public sensemaking and dialogue.  The throughline of his interests has to do with ways of improving the health and development of individuals and society, with a virtuous relationship between the two as a goal. Towards these ends, he’s had particular interest in the topics of catastrophic and existential risk, civilization and institutional decay and collapse as well as progress, collective action problems, social organization theories, and the relevant domains in philosophy and science.

29zh8ZiJtNL3RJArIvDyHJ,"20VC: Yann LeCun on Why Artificial Intelligence Will Not Dominate Humanity, Why the Size of Models Matters Less and Less & Why Open Models Beat Closed Models",2023-05-15,"Yann LeCun is VP & Chief AI Scientist at Meta and Silver Professor at NYU affiliated with the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences & the Center for Data Science. He was the founding Director of FAIR and of the NYU Center for Data Science. After a postdoc in Toronto he joined AT&T Bell Labs in 1988, and AT&T Labs in 1996 as Head of Image Processing Research. He joined NYU as a professor in 2003 and Meta/Facebook in 2013. He is the recipient of the 2018 ACM Turing Award for “conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing”. Huge thanks to David Marcus for helping to make this happen.  ------------------------------------------  Timestamps: (0:00) Introduction  (0:32) Yann LeCun's Journey to Chief AI Scientist at Meta: A History of AI  (6:25) The Rapid Progress of AI Today  (12:31) Prophecies of Doom: Debunking AI Misconceptions  (21:19) Open vs Closed-Models of AI; Where does the value go?

For 10 years plus, machine learning was in the shadows, how did Yann not get discouraged when the world did not appreciate the power of AI and ML?  What does Yann know now that he wishes he had known when he started his career in machine learning?  2.) The Next Five Years of AI: Hope or Horror:   Why does Yann believe it is nonsense that AI is dangerous?   Why does Yann think it is crazy to assume that AI will even want to dominate humans?   Why does Yann believe digital assistants will rule the world?   If digital assistants do rule the world, what interface wins? Search? Chat? What happens to Google when digital assistants rule the world?  3.) Will Anyone Have Jobs in a World of AI:    From speaking to many economists, why does Yann state “no economist thinks AI will replace jobs”?   What jobs does Yann expect to be created in the next generation of the AI economy?   What jobs does Yann believe are under more immediate threat/impact?   Why does Yann expect the speed of transition to be much slower than people anticipate?   Why does Yann believe Elon Musk is wrong to ask for the pausing of AI developments?  4.) Open or Closed: Who Wins:    Why does Yann know that the open model will beat the closed model?   Why is it superior for knowledge gathering and idea generation?   What are some core historical precedents that have proved this to be true?   What did Yann make of the leaked Google Memo last week?  5.) Startup vs Incumbent: Who Wins:    Who does Yann believe will win the next 5 years of AI; startups or incumbents?   How important are large models to winning in the next 12 months?   In what ways does regulation and legal stop incumbents? How has he seen this at Meta?   Has his role at Meta ever stopped him from being impartial? How does Yann deal with that?

4z1Vu8tHpeYuMpG5Rdopsi,"Inside the Minds of Spiders, Octopuses and Artificial Intelligence",2023-02-24,"Adrian Tchaikovsky’s “Children of Time” is about an advanced civilization built by sentient spiders. A sequel, “Children of Ruin,” is about a society run by superintelligent octopuses. I love these books. They’re remarkably serious about their premises, and by the end, it’s human civilization and our limited sensorium that come to seem strange.But Tchaikovsky’s latest book, “Children of Memory,” ostensibly about crows, read as something very different to me: the best fictional representation I’ve read of what it is like to interact with, and perhaps even be, an artificial intelligence system like ChatGPT. It was a very strange read at this moment. And it made possible an episode I’ve been wanting to do for months.Long before we have to face the question of whether A.I. is sentient, we will have to face the question of whether it is creative, and that will turn into the question of whether we, truly, are creative. And so Tchaikovsky and I talk about whether there’s a meaningful difference between human creativity and A.I. problem solving, why he believes this is a “profoundly scary time” to be a writer or a designer, what an explosion of A.I.-produced content would mean for human society and the human spirit, whether the advancement of A.I. could exhaust avenues for human originality and much more.Mentioned:""Melancholy Elephants"" by Spider RobinsonArrival, directed by Denis VilleneuveBook Recommendations:Soldier of the Mist by Gene WolfAfter Atlas by Emma NewmanBabel by R.

Clausewitz and Artificial Intelligence,2023-10-22,"In this episode, we're exploring the limitations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in making or advising on command decisions in war. With many advocates of AI suggesting that it will transform war, it's worth going back Clausewitz and what he teaches us about the nature of war. War cannot be reduced to algorithms, says Clausewitz, and so AI will only ever have a limited role in war - unless there's a major paradigm shift in how AI is developed.  To explain this argument further, we have Dr Cameron Hunter (University of Copenhagen, Denmark) on the show to tell us that, at present, AI can only do deductive and inductive reasoning, and so will never be able to grapple with the nuances of policy, strategy, and command. Because AI can only look for patterns in the available data, it cannot predict how the enemy might adapt and respond, nor can it account for chance or other intangible factors that shape war.

Robb explains buzzwords in AI and how it works, and he shares his personal experience of using AI to create a fitness program. Robb also discusses the potential dark side of AI and the ethical considerations that come with its use, including the fear of AI taking over jobs. He also touches on the difference between AI and AGI and the potential benefits and risks of AGI. The episode ends with the LeCount introducing the new Rich Dad Network show, the Blue Collar Rich Dad Podcast.------Please read carefully.This is not financial advice.You may be asking, “what does that mean?”Let me explain…Do not just do what I, my team or my guest says. That would be stupid and irresponsible. Take the education, then use your own brain and make your own decisions.YOU must take responsibility for your future and your success. That is why you are here. Neither I, or my team, or my guests, know your risk levels, prior education, emotional maturity or how much money you can afford to lose. We are only telling you what we believe to be smart moves. But you must decide for yourself. There are NEVER guarantees. Also understand that we are REAL teachers. We practice what we preach. With that in mind we often invest in the very projects that may be mentioned on this show. While it is never our intent, we could possibly profit from others investing in our recommendations.Take the education we provide but then determine your own actions. If it does not make sense to you, get more education before you invest. We will continue to provide education and there will always be more opportunities.This show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/5712278/advertisement",44.21,https://open.spotify.com/episode/77e46l2qTiAUX1U60nEVI4,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2023-06-14

2M65eSyJ0Gu3V9Jc0brLl5,Ep283 - John Searle | Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence,2022-10-07," Philosophy professor John Searle visits Google to discuss the philosophy of mind and the potential for consciousness in artificial intelligence.  John is widely noted for his contributions to the philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and social philosophy. Among his notable concepts is the ""Chinese room"" argument, which challenges the supposed language comprehension ability of artificial intelligence.  Searle conceived of the “Chinese room” thought experiment in 1980. Imagine a native English speaker who cannot read or speak Chinese, locked in a room with boxes of Chinese symbols together with a book of instructions for manipulating the symbols. Imagine that people outside the room send in other Chinese symbols which, unknown to the person in the room, are questions in Chinese. And imagine that by following the book of instructions, the man in the room can pass out Chinese symbols which are correct answers to the questions. Thus the person in the room is able to convince the people outside the room that he understands Chinese, but in fact he does not understand a word of Chinese.  The narrow conclusion of the argument is that programming a computer may make it appear to understand language, but cannot produce true comprehension. Searle argues the fact that computers merely use syntactic rules to manipulate symbol strings, but have no true grasp of meaning or semantics. Thus, the theory that human minds are computer-like computational or information processing systems is inadequate. Instead, the human mind must result from biological processes; computers can at best simulate these biological processes. His argument has large implications for semantics, philosophy of language and mind, theories of consciousness, computer science and cognitive science generally.

From my research into Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA to what developers of #ChatGPT and other AI are missing, I explore this most sensitive of issues.

AI can be used in any industry, even dream work. An AI system for interpreting dreams could be abusive if it were treated as a higher psychological authority; as an oracle of truth rather than a helpful tool. However, there are also many benefits when used correctly. Can a computer program interpret your dreams? If it could, would that be a good or bad thing? Where do YOU stand? Join the conversation, leave a review & follow us on social media!Today's guest, Joanna Kowalewska, is a certified dreamwork professional and Yoga Nidra facilitator.

A popular school of thought in AI is to just dump all the data you need into pre-training or fine tuning. But that may be less efficient and less controllable than alternatives — using AI models as a reasoning engine against external data sources. Kelvin Guu, Senior Staff Research Scientist at Google, joins Sarah and Elad this week to talk about retrieval, memory, training data attribution and model orchestration. At Google, he led some of the first efforts to leverage pre-trained LMs and neural retrievers, with >30 launches across multiple products.

We see it in everything from predictive text to facial recognition to mapping disease incidence. But increasingly machines show many of the same biases as humans, particularly with communities of color and vulnerable populations. In this episode, we learn how leading technologists are disrupting their own inventions to create a more humane AI.   For more information on this episode, visit nationalgeographic.com/overheard.   Want more? In 2020 widespread use of medical masks has created a new niche—face-mask recognition. The technology would help local governments enforce mask mandates, but is it worth it?  Thanks to evolution, human faces are much more variable than other body parts. In the words of one researcher, “It's like evolving a name tag.”  Most people have difficulty accurately recognizing strangers. But a few individuals—called super-recognizers—excel at the task. London police have employed some of these people to help find criminal suspects.   And for subscribers:  Artificial intelligence and robotics have been improving rapidly. Our cover story from September 2020 explores the latest robotic technology from around the world.  In 1976 Isaac Asimov wrote an article for National Geographic predicting how humans might live in 2026.   Also explore:  Take a look at the documentary Coded Bias, featuring AI researcher Joy Buolamwini. The film explores Joy’s research on racial bias in facial recognition AI.  Read the NIST report, co-authored by Patrick Grother and discussed in this episode.

1gls7E4MXLxGiiww0Zminy,#278 Artificial Intelligence w/ Roger McNamee,2023-07-17,"Roger McNamee has spent decades helping American tech companies secure financing. In the last few years, however, he’s become well-known for helping American citizens secure themselves against tech companies. After helping convince Mark Zuckerberg to retain control over Facebook, Roger documented social media’s role in amplifying social division in his 2019 New York Times Best Seller  Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe. Recently he’s turned his attention to AI, and he has a warning for us: don’t believe the hype. In this conversation Roger joins Bob and Ben to discuss Artificial Intelligence, why he says it’s far from the disruptor its proponents have claimed it to be, and how our current assessment of AI actually causes many of the problems that will likely come from this new technology. Roger also shares his solution to better tech regulation, why he’s more hopeful about the future of the US than he has been in decades, and his second career in his band Moonalice (click here for music and tour dates).  If you enjoy this conversation, you can hear our uncut conversation, which includes almost 30 minutes of additional audio, but joining us on Patreon at Patreon.com/TheRoadToNow.

In this episode, we explore the question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) could develop consciousness and what that could mean for the paranormal and for us as well. We discuss the basics of AI and its potential to enhance paranormal equipment as well as the possibility of AI developing emotions and the possible ethical implications of that scenario. Finally we delve into some interesting scenarios that could arise if AI were to become self-aware, leaving listeners to ponder the future of technology and consciousness.We'll Catch You Weirdos In The Next One..What's coming next? : An episode all about the Near Death Experiences!Next week Megan will delve into everything from seeing a bright light, the life view, and often unexplainable phenomena that occurs when we have near death experiences and almost cross to the other side.

In our conversation with Dan, we discuss the limitations of state space models in language modeling and the search for alternative building blocks that can help increase context length without being computationally infeasible. Dan walks us through the H3 architecture and Flash Attention technique, which can reduce the memory footprint of a model and make it feasible to fine-tune. We also explore his work on improving language models using synthetic languages, the issue of long sequence length affecting both training and inference in models, and the hope for finding something sub-quadratic that can perform language processing more effectively than the brute force approach of attention.

Richard previously served as the Chief Scientist and EVP at Salesforce. Before that, Richard was the CEO/CTO of AI startup MetaMind, acquired by Salesforce in 2016. He is widely recognized as having brought neural networks into the field of natural language processing, inventing the most widely used word vectors, contextual vectors and prompt engineering. He has over 150,000 citations and served as an adjunct professor in the computer science department at Stanford.    In Today's Episode with Richard Socher We Discuss:   1. The Decade-Long Journey to Becoming an AI OG:    How did Richard first make his way into the world of AI over a decade ago? What are 1-2 of his biggest lessons from working with Marc Benioff? How did 5 years at Salesforce impact how he both thinks and operates?    2. Models: Does Size Matter:    How important is model size? Is data size more important? What are the biggest misconceptions people have around models today? How does Richard respond to the suggestion that ""many startups are wrappers around LLMs""? Are hallucinations a feature or a bug?    3. Where Does Value Accrue:    Where does Richard believe most of the value will accrue; startup or incumbent? Which incumbents are best positioned to win? Which are the laggards and behind? What do many not see about the startup vs incumbent race in the AI war?    4. Open vs Closed: Which Wins:    Does Richard favour Yann LeCun's open approach? Or is the world of AI more closed? What are the biggest challenges of an open ecosystem? What are the nuances that make both challenging?    5. Richard Socher: AMA:    Why will carpenters be paid more than software engineers in 10 years? Why is AGI still way off? Are people too unrealistic?

0irOyac3oq9gFjruKQ3ZqK,Artificial Intelligence,2005-12-08,"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss artificial intelligence. Can machines think? It was a question posed by the mathematician and Bletchley Park code breaker Alan Turing and it is a question still being asked today. What is the difference between men and machines and what does it mean to be human? And if we can answer that question, is it possible to build a computer that can imitate the human mind? There are those who have always had robust answers to the questions that those who seek to create artificial intelligence have posed. In 1949 the eminent neurosurgeon, Professor Geoffrey Jefferson argued that the mechanical mind could never rival a human intelligence because it could never be conscious of what it did: ""Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt"", he declared ""and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain - that is, not only write it but know that it had written it."" Yet the quest rolled on for machines that were bigger and better at processing symbols and calculating infinite permutations. Who were the early pioneers of artificial intelligence and what drove them to imitate the operations of the human mind? Is intelligence the defining characteristic of humanity? And how has the quest for artificial intelligence been driven by warfare and conflict in the twentieth century?
