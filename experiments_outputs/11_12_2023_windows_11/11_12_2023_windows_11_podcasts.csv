Microsoft delivers the Windows 11 23H2 Update, which upgrades your Windows 11 version 22H2-based PC to version 23H2, much sooner than expected.  Technically, Microsoft NEVER delivered the so-called ""Fall Update,"" since it was only made available in preview form (twice, for some reason). So 23H2 is actually the first public release of those 150+ new features.  The Windows 11 Media Creation Tool still installs 22H2. Because Microsoft. Workaround: Use the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Which hilariously requires you to install the PC Health Check app.  We need to discuss Microsoft Teams in Windows 11. And then literally never discuss it again.  Microsoft is killing the Windows Insider MVP program. What exactly did it even mean to be an ""MVP"" in the Insider program?  Dev: From last Friday, adds one new feature, a ""Recently added"" folder (for apps) in Start (in Recommended)  Beta, from last Thursday: Two new features (gradual rollout): System components in Settings, Game Bar rebranding. Plus fixes.  Windows 11 now has 26 percent usage share vs. 69 percent for Windows 10.  Whatever happened to Windows 12?  There have been overt clues about Windows 12 literally all year, including as recently as last week. But Microsoft has never, not once, uttered this phrase. What's happening?  Microsoft 365/AI  Today's the day: Microsoft 365 Copilot arrives for commercial customers on E3 or higher.  OG Teams is retiring in March.  Microsoft Word turned 40 last week.  This was the gateway drug that lured Paul into the Microsoft ecosystem. But it's showing it's age. If Microsoft can't get spell- and grammar-checking right in Word, why will AI work?  Earnings Learnings  Did Azure just make more money than AWS??  Intel stumbles but finally sees an end to the PC sales slide.  Surface  iFixit now sells Surface replacement parts. And it is fascinating to see how much more you can replace/repair in newer models compared to the first ""repairable"" Surface, Surface Pro 7.  Xbox  Microsoft reorgs Xbox in the wake of Activision Blizzard acquisition.  Chris Capossela is Leaving Microsoft.  Paul has a very mysterious announcement to make for our holiday show this year!  Xbox October Update arrives with keyboard mapping for Elite Series 2 and Adaptive controllers.  There are a lot more titles coming to Xbox Game Pass in early November.  Microsoft will now block unofficial controllers on Xbox consoles.  Atari acquires Digital Eclipse, the retro game company behind that amazing Karateka interactive documentary.

As predicted, actually.  Last week was hell trying to figure out how/where people could get 23H2. Turns out, there's a reason. Microsoft is terrible.  A Microsoft employee notably—offered some clarity on the 23H2 rollout. 23H2 is available via the ISO download or Installation Assistant, as Paul noted last week. 23H2 is NOT available via the Media Creation Tool, as Paul also observed — delayed two weeks.  Canary build today: SMB changes (Server Message Block, not small business).  Microsoft deprecated some features in Windows 11 version 23H2 but didn't remove any (yet?).  The Windows Tips app was just deprecated too.  Microsoft to remove two in-box apps from clean installs in the future.  The HP Spectre Folding PC is a compelling argument for the hybrid PCs of the future.  More Revenues  Apple: Flat with last year, still all iPhone.  Qualcomm: Terrible, but also sees a rebound looming.  Surface  Microsoft extended Surface support for firmware/drivers from 4 years to 6 for newer models.  Microsoft 365/AI  Microsoft Authenticator quietly rolled out ""MFA Fatigue"" relief. You will have noticed this.  Microsoft launches Trustworthy Computing 2.0: The Cloudening.  A look at the M365 competition: Google Workspace good (especially Drive), Slack bad. REALLY bad.  Microsoft Edge 119 arrives with a few UI changes.  OpenAI had a little show and is offering custom ChatGPT clients.  Because we all need more Elon Musk in our lives, here's Grok.  Microsoft partners with Inworld on generative AI game development.  Xbox  Call of Duty MWIII multiplayer/full game arrive Friday.  Nintendo revenues up nicely. EA is in great shape.  Epic is in court vs. Google, this time could be different.

5U1hJHsMY6uL8IaERW4PhE,Est-on forcé de passer à Windows 11 ?,2023-05-18,"Êtes-vous déjà passé à Windows 11 ? Si oui, c’est top, si non, c’est une erreur… du moins selon Microsoft. Et le GAFAM compte bien vous forcer la main pour sauter le pas si vous utilisez encore Windows 10, quitte à devenir vraiment agaçant. Dans le détail, la dernière mise à jour de Windows 10 déployée en mai apporte une nouveauté intéressante. A chaque allumage de votre ordinateur, une publicité apparaît à l’écran. Impossible de ne pas la voir, puisqu’elle prend tout l’affichage et vous propose de passer à Windows 11 immédiatement ou de reporter la mise à niveau de votre système d’exploitation. Pour rester sur votre version actuelle, il faut cliquer sur un bouton assez discret en bas de la fenêtre. Si vous refusez la mise à jour, Windows 10 insiste avec de nouvelles fenêtres vantant les mérites de son OS. Il faut encore une fois recommencer l’opération pour enfin accéder à son bureau. À noter toutefois que ces fenêtres reviendront régulièrement sans compter des publicités pour s’abonner à Microsoft 365. Cette méthode arrive alors que la fin du support de Windows 10 21H2 arrive à son terme dans moins d’un mois. La société américaine espère laisser le moins d’utilisateurs possible sur le carreau. Dès lors, quoi de mieux que de les faire passer sur Windows 11 ? Si la nouvelle version de Windows est en effet accessible depuis presque deux ans maintenant, ceux qui restent sur Windows 10 le font volontairement et pas sûr que ces pop-ups leur fassent changer d’avis. Pour rappel, Windows 11 apporte un tout nouveau design ainsi que de nouvelles fonctionnalités. Par exemple, la barre des tâches a été repensée de zéro et est maintenant au centre de tout. Il est totalement gratuit pour les possesseurs de Windows 10. Problème, on se souvient que par le passé, ceux ayant tenté la mise à jour vers Windows 11 avaient pu expérimenter de gros bugs et un ralentissement de leur système. À voir si Microsoft a corrigé le tir. Si oui, sans doute qu’une telle communication agressive ne serait pas nécessaire. Learn more about your ad choices.

Canary build today: SMB changes (Server Message Block, not small business).  Microsoft deprecated some features in Windows 11 version 23H2 but didn't remove any (yet?).

Applications don't have a problem with the OS update, since, under the hood, it's Windows 10.1.

2zFPepUSCDsCRYP3aoPa9u,Hardware für Windows 11 und Planungstipps für Balkonkraftwerke | c't-uplink 48.1,2023-04-29,"Im c't-uplink 48.1 geht es um zwei verschiedene Themen: Die absurden Hardware-Anforderungen von Windows 11 und wie man Balkonkraftwerke plant.  Windows-11-Hardware  Windows 11 hat absurd hohe Hardwareanforderungen: Prozessoren jünger als 2017, 64 Bit, TPM2.0. Rechner, die das nicht erfüllen, laufen heute einfach mit Windows 10. Aber am 14. Oktober 2025 wird Microsoft aufhören, Sicherheitsupdates für Windows 10 herauszugeben und alle älteren Rechner können mangels Updates nicht mehr sinnvoll mit Windows betrieben werden.  Die Anforderungen wirken völlig willkürlich, weil es kaum einen Unterschied zwischen den unterstützen Prozessoren und den gerade nicht mehr unterstützen der nächstälteren Generation gibt. Die sind auch 2025 noch für viele Aufgaben schnell genug, weshalb Microsoft effektiv Firmen und Privatleute zwingt, bis zu diesen Stichtag funktionierende Rechner unnötig gegen neue auszutauschen. Für die Umwelt ist das eine Katastrophe und zudem eine vermeidbare Belastung für den Geldbeutel.  Der c’t-Prozessor-Spezialist Christof Windeck erklärt im c't-uplink im Gespräch mit Pina Merkert welche Hardware zukünftige Windows-11-Rechner mitbringen müssen und wo ein Upgrade sinnvoll sein kann. Außerdem deckt er auf, warum Microsoft so viele Rechner für untauglich erklärt und ob die Sicherheit von PCs sich mit der Umstellung verbessert.  Nach einer ganz kurzen Pause geht es weiter mit den zweiten Thema:  Planen von Balkonkraftwerken  Ein Balkonkraftwerk will man spätestens seit der letzten Stromrechnung. Die kleinen Photovoltaikanlagen an Balkongeländern, auf Garagen und Gartenhaus-Dächern, an Fassaden und Carports produzieren Strom, der direkt in der Wohnung verbraucht wird, in der sie angeschlossen werden. Jede selbst erzeugte Kilowattstunde muss man nicht vom Stromanbieter kaufen und so spart man Geld, obwohl man keinen eigenen Strom verkaufen kann.  Genehmigungspflichtig sind Balkonkraftwerke nicht, die Formalitäten sind sehr überschaubar. Das liegt auch daran, dass die kleinen Solaranlagen kaum Einfluss auf das Stromnetz haben - außer dass Netzbetreiber weniger verdienen. Wer für sein Balkonkraftwerk Vermieter oder eine Eigentümergemeinschaft überzeugen muss, sollte sich aber über die Formalitäten informiert haben. Am besten erledigt man das noch während der Planungsphase.  Andrijan Möcker hat eine frei verfügbare Vorlage für alle wichtigen Planungsschritte eines Balkonkraftwerks zusammen mit seinem Artikel in c't 10 veröffentlicht. Im Uplink-Studio erklärt er zusammen mit Jan Mahn und Pina Merkert, worauf man bei der Planung von Balkonkraftwerken achten sollte. Außerdem klärt das Trio, welche Schritte essenziell sind, auf welche Gefahren man achten sollte und ob sich die Wechselrichter-Preise stabilisiert haben.",41.89,https://open.spotify.com/episode/2zFPepUSCDsCRYP3aoPa9u,['de'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['lung'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-04-29

4e4BRPoZ931DM2NgCaiZQF,More Thoughts On Critical Windows,2023-08-30,"On the fetish post, I discussed people who had some early sexual experience - like seeing a sexy cartoon character - and reacted in some profound way, like becoming a furry. Sometimes people have described this as a “critical window” for sexuality (similar to the “critical period” in language learning?) where young children “imprint” on sexual experiences - and then can’t un-imprint on them later, even when they see many examples of sex that don’t involve cartoon animals. One of my distant cousins won't eat tomatoes. His parents say when he was very young, he bit into a cherry tomato and it exploded into goo in his mouth, and he was so upset he wouldn't eat tomatoes from then on. Now he’s in his 30s and still hates them. Is this fairly described as a “critical window” for food preferences?  https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/more-thoughts-on-critical-windows",3.98,https://open.spotify.com/episode/4e4BRPoZ931DM2NgCaiZQF,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['child'],['man'],[],2023-08-30

Microsoft delivers the Windows 11 23H2 Update, which upgrades your Windows 11 version 22H2-based PC to version 23H2, much sooner than expected.  Technically, Microsoft NEVER delivered the so-called ""Fall Update,"" since it was only made available in preview form (twice, for some reason). So 23H2 is actually the first public release of those 150+ new features.  The Windows 11 Media Creation Tool still installs 22H2. Because Microsoft. Workaround: Use the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Which hilariously requires you to install the PC Health Check app.  We need to discuss Microsoft Teams in Windows 11. And then literally never discuss it again.  Microsoft is killing the Windows Insider MVP program. What exactly did it even mean to be an ""MVP"" in the Insider program?  Dev: From last Friday, adds one new feature, a ""Recently added"" folder (for apps) in Start (in Recommended)  Beta, from last Thursday: Two new features (gradual rollout): System components in Settings, Game Bar rebranding. Plus fixes.  Windows 11 now has 26 percent usage share vs. 69 percent for Windows 10.  Whatever happened to Windows 12?  There have been overt clues about Windows 12 literally all year, including as recently as last week. But Microsoft has never, not once, uttered this phrase. What's happening?  Microsoft 365/AI  Today's the day: Microsoft 365 Copilot arrives for commercial customers on E3 or higher.  OG Teams is retiring in March.  Microsoft Word turned 40 last week.  This was the gateway drug that lured Paul into the Microsoft ecosystem. But it's showing it's age. If Microsoft can't get spell- and grammar-checking right in Word, why will AI work?  Earnings Learnings  Did Azure just make more money than AWS??  Intel stumbles but finally sees an end to the PC sales slide.  Surface  iFixit now sells Surface replacement parts. And it is fascinating to see how much more you can replace/repair in newer models compared to the first ""repairable"" Surface, Surface Pro 7.  Xbox  Microsoft reorgs Xbox in the wake of Activision Blizzard acquisition.  Chris Capossela is Leaving Microsoft.  Paul has a very mysterious announcement to make for our holiday show this year!  Xbox October Update arrives with keyboard mapping for Elite Series 2 and Adaptive controllers.  There are a lot more titles coming to Xbox Game Pass in early November.

Microsoft delivers the Windows 11 23H2 Update, which upgrades your Windows 11 version 22H2-based PC to version 23H2, much sooner than expected.  Technically, Microsoft NEVER delivered the so-called ""Fall Update,"" since it was only made available in preview form (twice, for some reason). So 23H2 is actually the first public release of those 150+ new features.   The Windows 11 Media Creation Tool still installs 22H2. Because Microsoft. Workaround: Use the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Which hilariously requires you to install the PC Health Check app.  We need to discuss Microsoft Teams in Windows 11. And then literally never discuss it again.  Microsoft is killing the Windows Insider MVP program. What exactly did it even mean to be an ""MVP"" in the Insider program?   Dev: From last Friday, adds one new feature, a ""Recently added"" folder (for apps) in Start (in Recommended)  Beta, from last Thursday: Two new features (gradual rollout): System components in Settings, Game Bar rebranding. Plus fixes.   Windows 11 now has 26 percent usage share vs. 69 percent for Windows 10.  Whatever happened to Windows 12?  There have been overt clues about Windows 12 literally all year, including as recently as last week. But Microsoft has never, not once, uttered this phrase. What's happening?  Microsoft 365/AI  Today's the day: Microsoft 365 Copilot arrives for commercial customers on E3 or higher.  OG Teams is retiring in March.  Microsoft Word turned 40 last week.  This was the gateway drug that lured Paul into the Microsoft ecosystem. But it's showing it's age. If Microsoft can't get spell- and grammar-checking right in Word, why will AI work?  Earnings Learnings   Did Azure just make more money than AWS??  Intel stumbles but finally sees an end to the PC sales slide.  Surface  iFixit now sells Surface replacement parts. And it is fascinating to see how much more you can replace/repair in newer models compared to the first ""repairable"" Surface, Surface Pro 7.  Xbox  Microsoft reorgs Xbox in the wake of Activision Blizzard acquisition.   Chris Capossela is Leaving Microsoft.  Paul has a very mysterious announcement to make for our holiday show this year!  Xbox October Update arrives with keyboard mapping for Elite Series 2 and Adaptive controllers.  There are a lot more titles coming to Xbox Game Pass in early November.  Microsoft will now block unofficial controllers on Xbox consoles.  Atari acquires Digital Eclipse, the retro game company behind that amazing Karateka interactive documentary.

7CPPIdBuv9XWywfAdGcSl2,Windows NT 5 becomes Windows 2000,2022-04-17,"Microsoft Windows 2000 was the successor to Windows NT 4.0, which had been released in 1997. Windows 2000 didn’t have a code name (supposedly because Jim Allchin didn’t like codenames), although its service packs did; Service Pack 1 and Windows 2000 64-bit were codenamed ""Asteroid"" and ""Janus,"" respectively. 2000 began as NT 5.0 but Microsoft announced the name change in 1998, in a signal with when customer might expect the OS.  Some of the enhancements were just to match the look and feel of the consumer Windows 98 counterpart. For example, the logo in the boot screens was cleaned up and they added new icons.  Some found Windows 2000 to be more reliable, others claimed it didn’t have enough new features. But what it might have lacked in features from a cursory glance, Windows 2000 made up for in stability, scalability, and reliability.  This time around, Microsoft had input from some of their larger partners. They released the operating system to partners in 1999, after releasing three release candidates or developer previews earlier that year. They needed to, if only so third parties could understand what items needed to be sold to customers. There were enough editions now, that it wasn’t uncommon for resellers to have to call the licensing desk at a distributor (similar to a wholesaler for packaged goods) in order to figure out what line items the reseller needed to put on a bid, or estimate.  Reporters hailed it as the most stable product ever produced by Microsoft. It was also the most secure version. 2000 brought Group Policies forward from NT and enhanced what could be controlled from a central system. The old single line domain concept for managing domains was enhanced to become what Microsoft called Active Directory, a modern directory service that located resources in a database and allowed for finely grained controls of those resources. Windows 2000 also introduced NTFS 3, an Encrypted File System that was built on top of layers of APIs, each with their own controls.  Still, Windows 98 was the most popular operating system in the world by then and it was harder to move people to it than initially expected. Microsoft released Windows 98 Second Edition in 1999 and then Windows Millennium Edition, or Me, in 2000. Millennium was a flop and helped move more people into 2000, even though 2000 was marketed as a business or enterprise operating system.  Windows 2000 Professional was the workstation workhorse. Active Directory and other server services ran on Windows 2000 Server Edition. They also released Advanced Server and Datacenter Server for even more advanced environments, with Datacenter able to support up to 32 CPUs. Professional borrowed many features from both NT and 98 Second Edition, including the Outlook Express email client, expanded file system support, WebDAV support, Windows Media Player, WDM (Windows Driver Model), the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for making it easier to manage those GPOs, support for new mass storage devices like Firewire, hibernation and passwords to wake up from hibernation, the System File Checker, new debugging options, better event logs, Windows Desktop Update (which gave us “Patch Tuesday”), a new Windows Installer, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), Plug and Play hardware (installing new hardware in Windows NT was a bit more like doing so in Unix than Windows 95), and all the transitions and animations of the Windows shell like an Explorer integrated with Internet Explorer.  Some of these features were abused. We got Code Red, Nimbda, and other malware that became high profile attacks against vulnerable binaries. These were unprecedented in terms of how quickly a flaw in the code could get abused en masse. Hundreds of thousands of computers could be infected in a matter of days with a well crafted exploit. Even some of the server services were exploited such as the IIS, or Internet Information Services server. Microsoft responded with security bulletins but buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities allows mass infections. So much so that the US and other governments got involved. This wasn’t made any easier by the fact that the source code for parts of 2000 was leaked on the Internet and had been used to help find new exploits. Yet Windows 2000 was still the most secure operating system Microsoft had put out. Imagine how many viruses and exploits would have appeared on all those computers if it hadn’t of been. And within Microsoft, Windows 2000 was a critical step toward mass adoption of the far more stable, technically sophisticated Windows NT platform. It demonstrated that a technologically powerful Windows operating system could also have a user-friendly interface and multimedia capabilities.",7.88,https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CPPIdBuv9XWywfAdGcSl2,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2022-04-17

Robyn has been making the world a more appealing place as a beauty maker and storyteller since her first smile. Robyn’s art education is informal and profuse; a daily act. Her favorite artwork is large in scale and she prefers to use acrylics, water-soluble graphite and crayons, to create representational, contemporary abstract paintings. In this way she is able to convey a dreamlike quality- reflecting the innocence and grandeur of where the private inner world and the wild outside meet.   Margo and Robyn discuss:   How Margo first discovered Robyn and how her creative path has evolved since that time.   The transformative power of art and the importance of personal growth and experimentation   Her artistic process and techniques as well as the challenges she has faced in the art world   The importance of community and the power of bravery in supporting one another   How her trauma has played a role in her creativity and even lends itself to her work   Her upcoming book, storytelling through painting, musings, and poetry   What it means to utilize rebel energy in creativity   Intuitive art making   And more!     Join Windowsill Chats Patreon for just $5 a month and receive early access to the Windowsill Chats Podcast, question submission for Q&A, replay's of monthly Q&A create-together sessions, a vibrant Facebook community, and more at www.patreon.com/inthewindowsill!   Connect with Robyn: https://www.instagram.com/robyn_thayer_fine_art www.RobynThayer.com https://m.facebook.com/RobynThayer-ProfessionalArtist   Connect with Margo: www.instagram.com/windowsillchats www.windowsillchats.com www.patreon.com/inthewindowsill  ",63.86,https://open.spotify.com/episode/21ghgvpmlT4dnAsabUKiVU,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2023-11-22

He lives in Haslemere, Surrey, but he is limited to just variable BT Internet with a max speed of 32Mbps down and 2-3Mbps up. He looked at 5G but not available in his area yet. Starlink costs him approx £90 per month. It delivers speeds consistently in the 80Mbps - 170Mbps range - and this is improving as Starlink adds more satellites. He does get dropouts of 3-6 seconds at times, now and then. The Starlink dish is mounted on his chimney and is slightly bigger than a Sky dish. It is motorised for tracking the satellites and heated to clear snow and ice. He's not had any overheating issues, but could see that might happen on a hot 30C+ day in direct sunlight.

2o4MNWaMjgmOEgSDzCTsLY,Was bei Windows 11 besser ist als vorher – und was schlechter | c’t uplink 40.8,2021-12-04,"Windows 11 ist seit einigen Monaten draußen: Zeit, Bilanz zu ziehen. Und: Wie gut läuft Windows 11 auf nicht unterstützten CPUs? Was kann der Android-Emulator?  Seit Anfang Oktober ist Windows 11 offiziell veröffentlicht, inzwischen hatte die c’t-Redaktion Zeit, sich intensiv mit dem neuen Betriebssystem auseinanderzusetzen. In c’t uplink erzählt Windows-Experte Jan Schüssler, was gut lief – und was schlecht. Zu den Kritikpunkten zählt beispielsweise die deutlich weniger konfigurierbare Taskleiste: Standardmäßig darf man sie nicht mehr woanders ankleben als am unteren Bildschirmrand, außerdem lässt sich die Gruppierung von laufenden Programmen nicht mehr abschalten, was zu Klick-Verwirrung führen kann. Obendrein nervt die vorinstallierte Teams-Version, in der man sich nicht mit Arbeits- oder Geschäftskonten einloggen kann.  Vielfach bemängelt wurde die schlechte Unterstützung älterer CPUs: Microsoft hat etliche Prozessoren, zum Teil erst vier Jahre alt, als mit Windows 11 inkompatibel eingestuft. Glücklicherweise lässt sich die Kompatibilitätserkennung abschalten, sodass man auch auf offiziell nicht unterstützter Hardware upgraden kann. c’t-Hardware-Redakteur Carsten Spille hat es ausprobiert und berichtet von seinen Erfahrungen – unter anderem installierte er Windows 11 auf einem uralten Pentium-4-System. Mehr dazu in diesem c’t-Artikel: https://www.heise.de/select/ct/2021/26/2130510441671824378 (Paywall; kostenlose Alternative: https://www.heise.de/tipps-tricks/Windows-11-PC-nicht-geeignet-was-tun-6207093.html)  Zu den überraschenderen Funktionen von Windows 11 gehört der Android-Emulator. Dieser ist zwar noch nicht offiziell in die finale Windows-11-Version integriert, lässt sich aber leicht nachinstallieren, siehe hier: https://www.heise.de/news/c-t-3003-Wie-man-Android-Apps-und-Linux-Software-unter-Windows-11-startet-6236917.html  Wie gut Android-Apps unter Windows 11 laufen, hat Jörg Wirtgen genauer erforscht. Und während sich alle Diskussionsteilnehmer einig sind, dass der Android-Emulator ein technisch interessantes Feature ist, scheint die Suche nach dem konkreten Nutzen etwas komplizierter zu sein.   === Anzeige / Sponsorenhinweis === /Thoughtworks ist eine führende globale Technologieberatung, die Strategie, Design und Softwareentwicklung ganzheitlich verbindet.

0IukVjvcGn4QD5b62qKlre,S03A45 -  Ge je betalen voor Windows 10 of upgraden?,2023-12-08,"Raymond Comvalius en Sander Berkouwer duiken in het meest recente nieuws en de informatiebeveiligingsupdates. Ze delen wederom de aankomende evenementen en een productiviteitstip.NieuwsRaymond dook afgelopen week in Windows Insider Build 23601 in het ontwikkelaarskanaal. Deze build introduceert vooral veel Windows 365-functionaliteit die ook uiteindelijk de weg zal vinden naar de Windows 11-werkplekken bij organisaties. Windows Insider build 22635.2841 in het bètakanaal komt uiteraard ook aan bod.Consumenten die Windows 10 na oktober 2025 op een veilige manier willen gebruiken gaan hiervoor betalen. Volgens de laatste geruchten gaat het over een fors bedrag per jaar. Printers die zich plots hernoemden naar een specifiek type HP LaserJet bleek de oorzaak voor de vele plotselinge HP Smart-installaties op Windows 10. Google Drive-gebruikers die gegevens kwijt zijn, kunnen deze vanaf versie 85.0.13.0 van de Google Drive desktop-app terugzetten.HaveIBeenPwned.com viert de tiende verjaardag. Sander geeft een tip voor beheerders om optimaal gebruik te maken van de geboden functionaliteit.iOS/iPadOS/Safar 17.1.2 en MacOS Sonoma 14.1.2 adresseerden op 30 november twee zero day-kwetsbaarheden in Webkit. Daarmee komt het totaal voor Apple in 2023 op twintig geadresseerde zero day-kwetsbaarheden.InformatiebeveiligingsupdateConfluence-, Jira- en BitBucket-beheerders dienen updates te installeren voor ernstige kwetsbaarheden in deze producten. Mensen met Zyxel network attached storage (NAS)-apparatuur met typenummers NAS326 en NAS542 dienen te updaten om een zwik kwetsbaarheden te dichten, waaronder drie ernstige kwetsbaarheden met CVSSv3-scores van 9.8.Er zijn wereldwijd zo'n dertigduizend kwetsbare Exchange Server-installaties, waarvan de helft in Europa staat. Raymond en Sander geven hun advies hoe om te gaan met deze installaties. Ze kijken ook naar het voorlopige politieke akkoord om beveiligingsupdates minimaal vijf jaar verplicht te laten aanbieden door leveranciers.Een onveilige paarmethode in de Bluetooth-standaard (CVE-2023-45866, maar CVE-2023-42929 voor Apple-apparatuur) kan kwaadwillenden de mogelijkheid geven om een toetsenbord te emuleren en zo code uit te voeren. Technisch gezien een remote code execution, inderdaad. Senator Ron Wyden heeft gevraagd of er meer transparantie kan worden gegeven omtrent de gerechtelijke bevelen aan Alphabet en Apple om notificaties in te zien. Sander merkt op dat organisaties zich tegen dit soort fratsen kunnen wapenen met o.a. Intune.EvenementenOp dinsdag 12 december organiseert Microsoft & Security NL bij Motion10 in Rotterdam de Xmas special, waarbij je foute kersttrui in de prijzen kan vallen. Op donderdag 14 december organiseren de Workplace Ninja's hun laatste meetup van 2023. Traditioneel vindt deze plaats bij servicebioscoop Hollywoud in Almkerk. De film die gezamenlijk kan worden bekeken is The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.ProductiviteitsipCommunicatieplatform X staat bol deze weken van de uitkomsten van prompts die mensen gebruiken richting Microsoft Designer. Op aka.ms/designme kun je namelijk op basis van een standaardprompt al hele mooie verschijningen produceren, maar de meest knotsgekke creaties komen voort uit geavanceerde prompt engineering, waarvan de voorbeelden ook uitbundig publiek gedeeld worden.De links bij deze shownotes zijn te vinden op https://itbros.nl/shows/s03a45",35.43,https://open.spotify.com/episode/0IukVjvcGn4QD5b62qKlre,['nl'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-12-08

Eigentlich soll die nächste Generation des Windows-Betriebssystems erst kommende Woche offiziell vorgestellt werden, Microsoft-CEO Satya Nadella spricht vom ""größten Update des Jahrzehnts"". Schon bei einem ersten Blick werden deutliche Änderungen am Design sichtbar, aber natürlich wird sich beim Nachfolger von Windows 10 noch viel mehr ändern. In der aktuellen Folge der #heiseshow lassen wir uns berichten, was die Vorabversion verrät und was dem Experten auffällt.  Welche Änderungen springen ins Auge? Was dürfte schon recht fertig sein, welche Veränderungen sind bis zur Freigabe einer ersten Version für die Öffentlichkeit noch zu erwarten? Was hat es mit dem neuen Startmenü auf sich? Wie ist der weitere Zeitplan für ""Windows 11"" und was passiert mit Windows 10? Was hat es mit der Aufregung um das Support-Ende von Windows 10 auf sich? Welche Erfahrungen hat Microsoft mit dem aktuellen Betriebssystem gemacht, die sich auf den Umgang mit Windows 11 auswirken könnten?  Darüber und über viele weitere Fragen auch aus dem Publikum sprechen Kristina Beer (@bee_k_bee) und Martin Holland (@fingolas) von heise online live am Donnerstag um 12 Uhr mit c't-Redakteur Jan Schüssler, der die Vorabversion angesehen hat.

Heather outlines how toys and children’s programming can act as both windows and mirrors for children - windows into others’ experiences and reflections of their own. We discuss the importance of providing children with materials that are both windows and mirrors, and how to do this.  Dr. Heather Homonoff Woodley, PhD is a Clinical Associate Professor of TESOL, Bilingual Education and World Language Education and the Director of Childhood Education in the Department of Teaching and Learning at New York University. Her research and courses focus on anti-racist, social justice-based, and multilingual education collaboratively with communities, families and youth. She has published articles, chapters and curriculum on multilingual classrooms, mother-scholars, and teaching for justice with comics and the arts. Heather received a 2020 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Faculty Award at NYU, a 2019 Steinhardt Teaching Excellence Award, a 2018 Steinhardt Diversity & Innovation Grant, and a 2014 Outstanding Dissertation Award from the National Association of Bilingual Education. She was a Fulbright Scholar in Morocco, and earned her PhD in Urban Education at The Graduate Center, City University of New York, her MS in Education (TESOL) from City College of New York, CUNY, and her BA in History from Wesleyan University.

By joining the club (www.bloomandgrowradio.com/garden-club) you’ll get access to the exclusive Bloom and Grow Garden Club Facebook Group, an online community of plant people and a free download of the special Bloom and Grow Radio “Keep Blooming” Print created by Molly Mansfield.

Mariane is a horticulturalist who has spent time in several different aspects of the garden world, from working in landscaping, to owning her own orchid business, to now managing the shop at the NYBG. She gives us a great tutorial on how to keep a windowsill herb garden and best practices for everything from setting it up to properly harvesting the growth. If you live in or around NYC, this weekend is the Specialty Plant Sale at the NYBG and I’m so excited to be participating in it this year. The sale is actually part of an epic weekend which features a demonstration from The Sill on Friday, Saturday I’ll be there in the house plant section from 12-4 and hope you’ll join me for some plant shopping, and Saturday is also the Third Annual Plein-Air Invitational which will feature 20 artists set up around the park painting in real time. I’m so excited for the large array of houseplants that will be at this sale, in addition to a ton of locally sourced herbs, that we can use for our herb gardens after listening to this episode! After my chat with Mariane, stay tuned because I dive into some lighting hacks I used to set up my herb garden, even though I don't have the proper light in my kitchen. In this episode we learn about: - Mariane’s journey to managing The Shop at NYBG - The skinny on what will be at the NYBG Plant Sale this May 5-7 - How to start a windowsill herb garden - Assessing light and what to do if you don't have enough - How to set up your garden - Pots and how their size and material are important - How to care for your herbs once they start growing - Best watering practices - How to properly prune your herbs - Suggested herbs for windowsill specific gardens - My lighting hack I used to put a high light herb garden in my low light kitchen - Special Bloom and Grow discounts for lights to help your herb gardens in low light apartments - For more information www.nybg.org to find out about all the events throughout the year Here is the information for the lights I use: Visit www.modsprout.com and use code B&G10 for 10% off their Growhouse (what I use in my kitchen) or growbar (what I use in my bookshelf) to create your herb garden in a low light apartment Visit www.soltechsolutionsllc.com and use code bloomandgrow15 for 15% off a grow lamp for larger plants, like indoor citrus (I use their 40 W lamp on my indoor lime tree) Bloom and Grow Radio is an affiliate partner with these companies and receives a portion of this sale at no extra cost to you.

0i0SoJbax4fpW6FJ09Wqxw,Windows 11: dit kunnen we verwachten,2021-06-23,"Microsoft onthult de nieuwste versie van Windows. Een testversie van Windows 11 is al uitgelekt en dat maakt een vooruitblik mogelijk. Welke vernieuwingen kan je verwachten? UPDATE: eerste indruk van Windows 11.   Tips uit deze aflevering: App: CrossOver, software waarmee het zonder tussenkomst van Windows mogelijk is om Windows-apps op een Mac te draaien, zelfs op een nieuwe Mac zonder Intel-chip. Werkt niet met alle apps en games, maar zeker een uitkomst voor minder zware software die niet bestaat voor macOS. Speelgoed: Lego Luigi, ook in Lego-vorm heeft Mario nu een broer. De Lego Mario Bros. kunnen via bluetooth aan elkaar gekoppeld worden, wat samen spelen nog leuker maakt. Ook zijn er veel nieuwe sets, waarmee nog grotere en gevarieerdere levels te bouwen zijn. Game: Lego Builder's Journey, een game die doet denken aan Monument Valley. Met Legoblokjes bouw je een pad waarop een zoon naar zijn vader kan lopen. Simpel maar prachtig vormgegeven, eerder al beschikbaar voor Apple Arcade, nu ook voor Nintendo Switch en pc. Film: The Trip to Greece. Voor de vierde en laatste keer gaan acteurs en comedians Rob Brydon en Steve Coogan samen op reis om restaurants te reviewen. Dit keer gaan ze naar Griekenland. Naast de gebruikelijke vermakelijke dialogen en hilarische persiflages op prachtige locaties dus ook veel Griekse mythologie. De film is online te huur via onder meer Ziggo On Demand, Picl, Pathe Thuis en Lumiere.

1kSXvnjDnMxknT0m00b4Zo,S03A37 - Windows 10 populair tegen wil en dank,2023-10-13,"Raymond Comvalius en Sander Berkouwer bespreken het meest recente nieuws, informatiebeveiligingsupdates en de evenementen voor de aankomende week. Raymond deelt een productiviteitstip op niveau.NieuwsTijdens de Patch Tuesday van oktober 2023 adresseerde Microsoft 103 kwetsbaarheden. Drie van deze kwetsbaarheden zijn bestempeld als zero day-kwetsbaarheden. Microsoft waarschuwt voor een (d)DoS-kwetsbaarheid die werd gedicht, waarvoor ook aanvullende registersleutels dienen te worden geconfigureerd. Dee kwetsbaarheid is reeds in het wild misbruikt richting Google die 398 miljoen requests per seconde op zich af kreeg gevuurd. Sander verdeelt de gedichte lekken op basis van soort, belangrijkheid en Top 5 Microsoft-producten, zodat IT-pro's goed voorbereid de discussie aan kunnen rondom de koffiemachine.Voor Windows 10 en Windows 11 zat de maandelijkse update vol met verrassingen. Raymond wijst daarnaast naar build 25967 in het blauwe kanariekanaal, build 23565 in het ontwikkelaarskanaal en build 22635.2419 in het bètakanaal. Vooral deze laatste Windows Insider build kent een verrassing. Voor zover de positieve verrassingen, want Intune kent momenteel een negatieve verrassing. De IT Bro's duiden de impact.Windows 10 blijkt flink populairder dan Windows 11. KNVI-leden weten de reden al ruim twee jaar, maar het is goed dat het nu ook publiek onderbouwd is met harde cijfers. Raymond deelt een (g)oude(n) tip voor thuisbeheerders. In Windows worden VBScript en NTLM op den duur uitgefaseerd. Microsoft Entra claimde vorige maand features in producten van andere teams, maar bracht zelf ook mooie nieuwe functionaliteit.Windows Server 2012 en Windows Server 2012 R2 verdwijnen achter de ondersteuningshorizon, behalve voor organisaties met diepe zakken en/of Azure-abonnementen. Raymond en Sander halen herinneringen op aan deze voor hen legendarische besturingssystemen.InformatiebeveiligingsupdatesDe vorige week besproken beveiligingsupdate voor Curl is uitgebracht. Deze update adresseert een ernstige heap overflow-kwetsbaarheid. Citrix adresseerde kwetsbaarheden in NetScaler ADC- en NetScaler Gateway-appliances. De IT Bro's hangen het meest recent bekend geworden prijskaartje aan het belang om bij te blijven met informatiebeveiligingsupdates.EvenementenOp donderdagavond 19 oktober 2023 kun je kiezen tussen:Een meet-up van Azure Platform Engineering (APE) over DevOps en IaC op SchipholEen meet-up van MC2MC in Kortrijk over Teams, Azure AI en PurviewOp zaterdag 21 oktober strijken de CollabDays neer in Brussel. Iedereen kent iedereen die iets doet met Microsoft 365  het Power Platform op dit evenement.ProductiviteitstipIn iOS 17 introduceerde Apple een nieuwe feature in de Camera-app. Op Engelstalige toestellen kun je de level-functionaliteit aanzetten. Op Nederlandstalige toestellen heet dit Niveau. Wanneer je deze feature aanzet, dan toont de iPhone wanneer je een foto maakt een witte balk die als waterpas fungeert. Houd je de telefoon precies horizontaal, dan kleurt de balk geel en verdwijnt deze automatisch uit beeld. Op deze manier kun je de telefoon perfect recht houden wanneer je foto's maakt.De links bij deze shownotes zijn te vinden op https://itbros.nl/shows/s03a37",33.01,https://open.spotify.com/episode/1kSXvnjDnMxknT0m00b4Zo,['nl'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-10-13

1PRvP9UzkyEi6LQhZ1oeDM,Windows 1-3 (SFT 7),2022-07-07,"1983 kündigt Microsoft an, seinem altertümlichen Kommandozeilen-Betriebssystem DOS eine moderne, intuitiv bedienbare grafische Oberfläche zu verpassen. Sie soll dem PC neben Icons, Fenstern und Maussteuerung auch Multitasking sowie ein einheitliches Bedienkonzept bescheren – und so die Plattform in die Zukunft führen. Doch Windows bleibt in jeder Hinsicht hinter den Erwartungen zurück, vor allem aber hinter dem Zeitplan.   Als es Ende 1985 endlich erscheint, verkauft es sich schleppend und muss überdies bestehen gegen einen mächtigen Gegner aus eigenem Hause, das »Betriebssystem der Neunzigerjahre« namens OS/2. Die Chancen für eine Fortsetzung stehen schlecht. Doch Windows überlebt nicht nur, es setzt sich durch – und führt mit Version 3.0 tatsächlich die Plattform in die Zukunft.

Vor allem hat sich viel im Design und den Möglichkeiten getan, mit denen man Fenster organisieren kann. Auch als Mac-Fans können wir dem neuen Betriebssystem einiges abgewinnen und Android Apps kommen erstmals durch den Amazon AppStore auf Windows.Deno hat eine neue Funktionalität mit Deno Deploy vorgestellt. Man kann sich das als Cloud Functions für Deno vorstellen und das Versprechen ist, dass Deno den schnellsten Deploy bereitstellen möchte und eure Anwendungen weltweit super schnell erreichbar sind. Wenn ihr Deno spannend findet, hört doch mal in Folge 73, wo wir euch einen ersten Überblick geben.Zu guter Letzt sprechen wir über eine Erweiterung der GitHub Issues – wobei man bei all den Funktionalitäten eigentlich von einem neuen Feature sprechen müsste.

3NmMoKinTQ7qAn0wLe3edv,Windows 11 - Hardware-Limits und Bugs zum Start  | c't uplink 40.0,2021-10-09,"Heute in c't uplink sprechen wir über den Start von Windows 11: Wie streng sind die Vorgaben zu TPM und CPUs wirklich? Und wer ist von Performance-Einbußen betroffen?  In der aktuellen Folge c't uplink dreht sich alles um den Start von Windows 11. Microsoft hat zwar mit dem Rollout begonnen, doch ein automatisches Update bekommt derzeit kaum einer. Wir erklären, wie man das Update händisch anstößt, wie streng Microsoft die Hardware-Vorgaben durchsetzt, wie man die Anforderungen umgeht -- und welche Probleme es zum Start gab.  Zum Start melden einige Performance-Probleme. Einige AMD-Ryzen-CPUs laufen derzeit unter Windows 11 langsamer, außerdem gibt es bei einigen Benchmarks bei aktiviertem Security-Feature HCVI Einbußen. Ersteres soll ein Patch demnächst beheben, zweiteres dürfte man im Alltag kaum merken, schätzt Christof Windeck ein. Er und das c't-Hardware-Team testen aktuell auf diversen Rechnern, wo es noch hakt.  Insgesamt läuft Windows 11 aber jetzt schon relativ rund, so das Fazit von Jan Schüßler im c't uplink. Auch hat Microsoft in letzter Minute vor dem Release-Termin einige Fehler behoben, die Jan noch einige Tage zuvor in der eigentlich schon finalen Version bemängelt hatte. Nicht geschafft ins Release hat es bisher die versprochene Möglichkeit, Android-Apps in Windows 11 zu starten.

The Incompetent Coup and the Men who Fall Out of Windows,2023-07-01,"Please join us at patreon.com/tortoiseshack As the world watched the incompetent Wagner coup fall apart, we were also trashing around for insights on what it all meant. One person who preached caution and less hyperbole was Economics Professor, Russian-Irish man and tortoise shack regular, Constantin Gurdgiev. He rejoins us to talk about the implications for Putin, Wagner ""CEO"" Yevgeni Progozhin, Ukraine and the rest of us. He explains the Kremlin power dynamics, the rise of Progozhin from hotdog salesman to mercenary army war criminal and who needs to stay away from tall buildings. Then we dive into what systemic corruption does to the concept of accountability via the lens of both the incompetent coup and RTE's week from hell.

09aYGXrphvObNQfXhJmni0,"Sorrows And Windows For Sorrow: Inferno, Canto XIII, Lines 79 - 108",2021-05-26,"Pier seemed to have come to a conclusion in his last speech with Virgil and our pilgrim, Dante. But he's clearly not done. Prompted by Dante, Virgil asks the shade how it got to be a bush and (more tellingly) whether it can escape.This is a passage rife with problems: Virgil's dualism, at odds with a Christian understanding of the resurrection; Dante-the-pilgrim's on-going silence in the face of his own sorrows; Pier's rhetorical flourishes which become less and less pronounced the closer he gets to speaking about the Last Judgment, the end of time.If anything, Pier's second speech in Canto XIII of Inferno brings up more questions than it answers. This is complicated literary territory. Join me, Mark Scarbrough, as I take it step by step, exploring one of the most dazzling cantos of Inferno.Here are the segments for this episode:[01:14] My English translation of the passage from Canto XIII of Inferno: lines 79 - 108. If you'd like to see this translation ""in the flesh"" (hello, Pier!), it lives on my website, markscarbrough.com.[03:26] The passage starts with someone's hesitation. Whose? Virgil's? Pier's? It's more complicated than you might think.[05:06] The first words of our pilgrim, Dante, since way back in Canto XI. And he doesn't say much--except to reiterate the problem of belief and trust in a literary context. Why has our pilgrim been silent? I have several answers, including the notion that we might be in a thematic progression since Canto X with Farinata.[09:31] Virgil's response to the pilgrim--and a literary tie-back to Canto X.[12:07] Virgil seems caught in a potential heresy. The old classical poet appears to be a dualist, thinking the mind and body are separate things.[14:46] Pier's second speech--and the answer to what happens to the suicides in the resurrection.[20:57] The story of the metamorphosis itself: an infernal take on one of Jesus's parables and a tribute to Ovid, all in one short passage.[24:48] Pier's final moments: a strange fusion of Dantean heresy (theological suicide? literary suicide?) and Pier's final honesty after so much rhetorical fandango.[27:54] A final shot: there may be a reference to Judas Iscariot running throughout all of Pier's speeches.",32.48,https://open.spotify.com/episode/09aYGXrphvObNQfXhJmni0,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2021-05-26

6zXBQrlIp8g9M3bOPCL8Un,Windows 11 introduce Copilot,2023-09-22,"Windows 11 introduce Copilot, una potente IA que transforma la experiencia del usuario, combinando funcionalidades y mejorando la productividad a partir del 26 de septiembre. Microsoft revela su ambiciosa actualización para Windows 11, centrada en Copilot, un asistente AI que revoluciona la interacción del usuario. Las mejoras se extienden desde Paint y Photos hasta Bing, con características diseñadas para impulsar la creatividad y eficiencia. ¿El futuro es ahora? Microsoft piensa que sí. Microsoft, en su evento anual, presentó su gran avance hacia una integración más profunda de la inteligencia artificial en su ecosistema. Más allá de solo ser una actualización, es una revolución de cómo interactuamos con la tecnología. Copilot, siendo la estrella del show, promete ser un asistente que aprende, se adapta y ayuda a medida que más lo utilizamos. A pesar de los esfuerzos anteriores, como Cortana, Microsoft aún no había logrado consolidar un asistente virtual que estuviera a la par con sus competidores. Los usuarios buscaban una herramienta más integrada, personalizable y que pudiera anticipar sus necesidades en lugar de simplemente responder a comandos. Copilot no es solo una respuesta a esta demanda, sino una superación de las expectativas. Integrado en aplicaciones, desde Paint hasta Microsoft 365, la nueva IA se despliega como una verdadera copiloto digital, aprendiendo de nuestros hábitos, ofreciendo soluciones personalizadas y haciendo la vida digital más sencilla y productiva. 🎙️ Escucha más sobre la inteligencia artificial de Microsoft en el pódcast El Siglo 21 es Hoy: ElSiglo21esHoy.com📚 Bibliografía:Microsoft Official BlogEngadgetThe VergeImagen: Press Microsoft Official BlogPara tener Microsoft Copilot en tu Windows, deberás seguir los siguientes pasos:Actualización de Windows: Asegúrate de tener la versión más reciente de Windows 11. Según el comunicado, Copilot comenzará a implementarse en su forma inicial como parte de una actualización gratuita de Windows 11, que empezará el 26 de septiembre en la noche. Puedes verificar si hay actualizaciones disponibles yendo a ""Configuración"" > ""Actualización y seguridad"" > ""Windows Update"" y haciendo clic en ""Buscar actualizaciones"".Instalación de Copilot: Una vez que la actualización esté disponible y hayas actualizado tu sistema, Microsoft Copilot debería instalarse automáticamente como una función integrada.Integración con otros servicios: Asegúrate de iniciar sesión con tu cuenta de Microsoft para aprovechar al máximo las características de Copilot, especialmente si utilizas otros productos de Microsoft como Microsoft 365, Bing o Edge. La integración entre estos servicios potenciará la experiencia de Copilot.Configuración de privacidad: Dado que Copilot utilizará el contexto, la inteligencia de la web y tus datos de trabajo para ofrecer asistencia, es importante revisar y ajustar tus configuraciones de privacidad según tus preferencias.Uso de Copilot: Una vez instalado y configurado, puedes comenzar a usar Copilot. Según el comunicado, funcionará como una aplicación o se revelará automáticamente con un clic derecho, y también podría accederse a través de combinaciones de teclas, como Win+C.Mantente informado: Como Microsoft planea continuar añadiendo capacidades y conexiones a Copilot con el tiempo, es recomendable estar atento a las actualizaciones y anuncios futuros de Microsoft para aprovechar al máximo las nuevas características y funcionalidades.Es posible que Microsoft proporcione instrucciones más detalladas o un proceso específico una vez que el lanzamiento oficial haya ocurrido. Te recomendaría consultar el sitio web oficial de Microsoft o el soporte técnico para obtener información actualizada y pasos específicos.This show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/5835407/advertisement",3.15,https://open.spotify.com/episode/6zXBQrlIp8g9M3bOPCL8Un,['es'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['seguridad en el trabajo'],[],[],[],[],[],[],['mejora'],['esfuerzo'],[],[],['habitos'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-09-22

5vF9p1aGR2YAZanjtmgae6,101: Windows Virtual Desktop with Travis Roberts,2021-01-28,"In this episode we're catching up with Travis Roberts to chat about all things Windows Virtual Desktop, Azure, and a lot more.In part due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, 2020 saw the use of Windows Virtual Desktop soar. Many companies are in the process of switching their networks over to the Cloud. Mike’s guest today is Travis Roberts, the Senior Networking Systems Administrator at RBA Consulting. Travis has a background of working in corporate IT for over 20 years, but he made a switch when he realized he wanted to focus less on management and more on consulting. He has lots of experience with Windows Virtual Desktop (and more) and creates content online to help others learn how to better utilize this technology.In this episode, we talk about…Travis’s background, how he got into consulting, and what the transition was like coming to that from corporate jobs.How Azure has been ramping up and is currently neck and neck with AWS.Why, at this point, most Systems Administrators are essentially Cloud Developers, as well.How you have to think a bit differently when using ARM templates and PowerShell.Why moving to the Cloud can save a business a lot of overhead expenses.The mindset shift involved in maintaining a server rack with manual switches and buttons, versus working within Azure.Why setting up a virtual network within Windows Virtual Desktop is so much faster than the traditional means.Why you need to continuously learn given the way technology is shifting now -and how if you learn it sooner, you can help others as they shift to the Cloud during the next decade.How building a brand can help you, and if you’re interested, you should start writing a blog or making Youtube videos.The importance of Source Control and how Travis has been using Github.The switch from using JSON to using HCL.How Travis has been seeing that he’s been needing to learn more about Continuous Integration.Resources from this episode:Travis on TwitterTravis onYouTubeTravis on LinkedInUdemy Course Discount: Zero to Hero with Windows Virtual Desktop",29.43,https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vF9p1aGR2YAZanjtmgae6,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2021-01-28

5JPYYm4aMdLDef3R3ELzfw,Windows 11  | c't uplink 38.8,2021-07-17,"Microsoft hat Windows 11 vorgestellt. Die Kacheln sind weg, aber was ändert sich sonst für Anwender und Entwickler? Und lieferte Linux manch eine Inspiration?  Einst versicherte Microsoft, dass auf Windows 10 keine neue Version folgen werde. Neue Funktionen sollten stattdessen fortwährend mit den halbjährlichen Updates kommen. Doch nun hat der Software-Riese aus Redmond doch Windows 11 präsentiert. Ins Auge sticht vor allem das neue Aussehen: Heller, freundlicher, übersichtlicher. Die Taskleiste und das Startmenü haben die Windows-Entwickler ebenso überarbeitet, wie den Explorer, die Einstellungen oder den Store.  Die Windows-Experten der c‘t-Redaktion haben die Vorabversion von Windows 11 unter die Lupe genommen. Jan Schüssler gibt einen Überblick über die Änderungen und neuen Funktionen von Windows 11. Die von Microsoft genannten Hardware-Anforderung ordnet Florian Müssig ebenso ein, wie die Aufregung darüber. Was sich für Software-Entwickler ändert und welche Wege es gibt, die eigene App auf Microsofts Plattform zu bekommen, erläutert Hajo Schulz.  Über ihre Eindrücke und Einschätzungen diskutieren sie gemeinsam mit Moderator Keywan Tonekaboni. Den erinnert Windows 11 hier und da sogar an Linux. Wo sehen die c’t-Redakteure Ähnlichkeiten von Windows 11 mit anderen Betriebssystemen? Welche Funktionen überzeugen sie und wo enttäuscht Microsoft?

2nmMqOUX4YmITLUfEisB0T,#137: David Bombal: Can CML (VIRL 2) run Windows 10 VMs?,2020-05-08,"Can CML support multivendor topologies? Can you use other vendor VMs with CML? These are often asked questions. In this video I'm going to show you how to run a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM) in Cisco CML (VIRL 2). Be warned! There are a number of steps required to make this work, but it's definitely possible. This is Part 7 of my CML (VIRL 2) series showing you how to download, install and configure Cisco VIRL 2 (CML-P). The new version of Cisco VIRL allows you to create virtual Cisco networks using just your Web browser. You don't have to use a thick client or any other software - everything is included and everything is easy to use. The new version of Cisco CML is one of your best options for CCNA, CCNP and CCIE Labs. CML has multiple advantages over other platforms such as GNS3 or EVE-NG. CML supports an HTML5 web client and contains all the Cisco IOS images. You don't have to use a thick client like you do with GNS3. You don't have to follow a convoluted process to get Cisco images working like you do with EVE-NG. You don't have to try to find images as they are all included as part of your CML subscription and by simply mapping an ISO drive to your virtual machine you can immediately start using all Cisco IOS images in your topologies. Both EVE-NG and GNS3 require that you provide your own IOS images - typically they recommend that you buy a CML subscription anyway. That means that you are already paying for CML. CML (VIRL2) is also an official Cisco product - that means that you don't have to worry about any gray legal issues with regards to running Cisco IOS images on your laptop. This is an official Cisco product that is supported by Cisco. By paying your yearly subscription fee of $199, you can use Cisco IOS images such as IOSv, IOSvL2, ASAv, NX-OSv and others without any worries. CML (VIRL 2) has everything you need to get started. Disadvantages include the requirement to license your installation. That however has been simplified dramatically from previous releases. There is also a 20 node limited in topologies. However, for most of us that is fine for a lot of labs. Is VIRL better than GNS3 or EVE-NG? In many ways it is. But, all platforms have advantages and disadvantages. If you are studying for your ccie, you many prefer gns3 or eve-ng as they don't limit the number of devices in a topology like virl does. VIRL-PE limits you to 20 devices - so your topologies cannot be massive like they could with gns3 or eve ng. However, if you are studying for your ccna or ccnp, VIRL may be more than enough. Cisco have made massive changes to their certification programs and it is fantastic to see the new version of VIRL in action.",37.36,https://open.spotify.com/episode/2nmMqOUX4YmITLUfEisB0T,['en-US'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2020-05-08

3bewWYpJHmJj0Qv52vgmfX,Windows Weekly 853: Ten Outta Ten for the 404!,2023-11-01,"On this episode, Leo, Paul, and Richard discuss the big release of Windows 11 23H2, productivity in Macs vs PCs, Microsoft 365 Copilot arriving, changes in the Xbox and marketing divisions, iFixit support for Surface repair, and American rye whiskeys.  23H2  Surprise! Microsoft delivers the Windows 11 23H2 Update, which upgrades your Windows 11 version 22H2-based PC to version 23H2, much sooner than expected.  Technically, Microsoft NEVER delivered the so-called ""Fall Update,"" since it was only made available in preview form (twice, for some reason). So 23H2 is actually the first public release of those 150+ new features.   The Windows 11 Media Creation Tool still installs 22H2. Because Microsoft. Workaround: Use the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Which hilariously requires you to install the PC Health Check app.  We need to discuss Microsoft Teams in Windows 11. And then literally never discuss it again.  Microsoft is killing the Windows Insider MVP program. What exactly did it even mean to be an ""MVP"" in the Insider program?   Dev: From last Friday, adds one new feature, a ""Recently added"" folder (for apps) in Start (in Recommended)  Beta, from last Thursday: Two new features (gradual rollout): System components in Settings, Game Bar rebranding. Plus fixes.   Windows 11 now has 26 percent usage share vs. 69 percent for Windows 10.  Whatever happened to Windows 12?  There have been overt clues about Windows 12 literally all year, including as recently as last week. But Microsoft has never, not once, uttered this phrase. What's happening?  Microsoft 365/AI  Today's the day: Microsoft 365 Copilot arrives for commercial customers on E3 or higher.  OG Teams is retiring in March.  Microsoft Word turned 40 last week.  This was the gateway drug that lured Paul into the Microsoft ecosystem. But it's showing it's age. If Microsoft can't get spell- and grammar-checking right in Word, why will AI work?  Earnings Learnings   Did Azure just make more money than AWS??  Intel stumbles but finally sees an end to the PC sales slide.  Surface  iFixit now sells Surface replacement parts. And it is fascinating to see how much more you can replace/repair in newer models compared to the first ""repairable"" Surface, Surface Pro 7.  Xbox  Microsoft reorgs Xbox in the wake of Activision Blizzard acquisition.   Chris Capossela is Leaving Microsoft.  Paul has a very mysterious announcement to make for our holiday show this year!  Xbox October Update arrives with keyboard mapping for Elite Series 2 and Adaptive controllers.  There are a lot more titles coming to Xbox Game Pass in early November.  Microsoft will now block unofficial controllers on Xbox consoles.  Atari acquires Digital Eclipse, the retro game company behind that amazing Karateka interactive documentary.

Microsoft Special Event: Blockbuster... or blockluster?  Paul went to his first in-person Microsoft event in almost four years. You're not going to believe what happened next!  Ahead of the event, everyone was calling this a ""Surface event"" and some still are. But it was an AI event, period. Were our expectations met?  Copilot ""rebrand"" was in many ways the biggest news  Microsoft 365 Commercial arrives November 1 - And Microsoft 365 consumer is a thing  Microsoft announced two Surface PCs at event, one with an NPU. And then two other Surface PCs/devices. Most of these do not matter  WTF is happening with Windows 11 23H2?

At special event, Microsoft reveals it will ship ""next major Windows 11 update"" September 26. It's 23H2! It's not 23H2!  One day after the event, Release Preview gets Fall Update  Paul attempted to achieve some clarity ahead of John Cable's post  Microsoft releases the Fall Update (in preview form)  Is Windows 11 finally where it needed to be when Microsoft shipped v1 two years ago?

Ganz im Gegenteil gibt es sogar viel zu besprechen. In dieser Folge diskutieren wir über Twitters neues Leselimit und wie Meta mit seiner App Threads davon profitieren könnte. Microsoft schickt derweil Windows 11 in die Cloud, was Vor- und Nachteile mit sich bringt, und wir werfen noch einen Blick auf ein Jahr Gigabitstrategie.  Außerdem hat Moderatorin Tabea wieder einen Nerd-Geburtstag, die WTF der Woche und knifflige Quizfragen mit dabei.  Wie immer freuen wir uns über die Beteiligung der Zuschauerinnen und Zuschauer. Vorab im Forum sowie live in der Sendung im Chat können Fragen gestellt werden, die wir in der Sendung aufgreifen.  **Die Themen in dieser Ausgabe**  Moderatorin Tabea Hartwich, heise online-Chefredakteur Dr. Volker Zota (@DocZet) und Redakteur Malte Kirchner (@maltekir) sprechen in dieser Ausgabe unter anderem über folgende Themen:  - Twitter limitiert, Threads kommt: Twitter überraschte am Wochenende mit einem Leselimit für Tweets, das sogleich zweimal hochgesetzt wurde. Meta steckt derweil in den Startlöchern für seinen Twitter-Konkurrenten Threads. Wird das Leselimit Twitter schaden? Geht es dabei nur um Abonnentengewinnung? Wie schädlich sind die KI-Bots wirklich, die angeblich den Dienst lahmzulegen drohen? Hat Meta eine Chance gegen Twitter? Und was ist überhaupt mit Mastodon als Alternative? - Windows 11 zieht in die Cloud um: Die lokale Installation von Betriebssystem könnte künftig zum Auslaufmodell werden, wenn Microsoft Pläne umsetzt, Windows 11 auch für Privatanwender in der Cloud anzubieten. Welche Vorteile hat das überhaupt? Gibt es dafür die nötigen Internetanschlüsse? Was spricht dagegen? Und wie steht es überhaupt um den Datenschutz? - Ein Jahr Gigabitstrategie: In dieser Woche ist die Gigabitstrategie in Deutschland ein Jahr alt. Zwar gibt es Fortschritte zu verzeichnen, aber vom Vorzeigestatus ist das Land noch weit entfernt. Ist das Ziel, bis Ende 2025 mindestens die Hälfte der Haushalte ans Highspeed-Netz anzuschließen, realistisch? Liegt der Ausbau bei den TK-Firmen in guten Händen?

5rne8QkUzzCpnCN8lJTNXh,S03A36 - Moment 4 features in Windows 11 op een rijtje,2023-10-06,"Na hun vakantie bespreken Raymond Comvalius en Sander Berkouwer het meest recente nieuws, informatiebeveiligingsupdates en de evenementen voor de aankomende week. Raymond zoomt verder in op Visual Studio Code voor de productiviteitstip.NieuwsOp 4 oktober stelde Windows Insider build 23560 beschikbaar in het ontwikkelaarskanaal. Hierin is een verbetering voor Windows Copilot opgenomen. Het grote Windows-nieuws van de afgelopen twee weken was echter de release van Windows 11 23H2-die-geen-23H2-heet. Raymond houdt het voorlopig bij ‘De Moment 4-update’.De IT Bro’s lopen door de nieuwe features heen, hoewel deze in recente afleveringen de revue reeds zijn gepasseerd. De nieuwe Windows-release kent ook nieuws op het gebied van passkeys, het aanmeldscherm en over de upgrades vanaf Windows 7 en Windows 8.Passkeys zijn nu ook beschikbaar binnen 1Password op iOS. Op passkeys.directory vind je een lijst met alle websites die passkeys ondersteunen.Op 26 september lanceerde Microsoft ook de Windows 365 Boot en Windows 365 Switch-functionaliteit. Vanaf 25 oktober is ook de Town Halls-functionaliteit beschikbaar in Teams. De oude Live Events zijn nog in Teams beschikbaar tot 30 september 2024.Op 1 november mogen we Microsoft 365 Copilot verwachten. Raymond deelt alle nu bekende details. Qua AI stapte ook Amazon afgelopen week in, samen met Anthropic.InformatiebeveiligingsupdatesOp het gebied van informatiebeveiliging gebeurt elke week wel iets. De IT Bro’s vragen aandacht voor de volgende informatiebeveiligingsupdates:iOS 17.0.3 dicht de lekken met rugnummers CVE-2023-42824 en CVE-2023-5217. Deze zero day-kwetsbaarheden kunnen leiden tot gehele overname van de telefoon.Microsoft Edge en Teams kregen updates. Zero day-kwetsbaarheden in open source libraries libwebp (CVE-2023-4863) en libvpx (CVE-2023-5217) noopten tot actie van verschillende leveranciers. Deze kwetsbaarheden werden reeds in het wild misbruikt, volgens Google.Een kwetsbaarheid in curl (CVE-2023-38545) wordt momenteel gedicht. De patch wordt op 11 oktober verwacht.Een Elevation of Privilege-kwetsbaarheid in de Linux-kernel (CVE-2023-4911) zorgt ervoor dat ook Linux-beheerders werk hebben.Atlassian geeft aan dat versie 8.x van hun Confluence-serverproduct kwetsbaar is. Update naar versie 8.3.3, 8.4.3, 8.5.2, of nieuwer om dit kritieke lek (CVE-2023-22515) te dichten.EvenementenDe South Coast Summit vindt in het weekend van 14 oktober plaats. Dichter bij huis kun je op donderdag 12 oktober vanaf 18:00 aanschuiven bij de DIWUG voor hun meetup rondom Entra ID en Microsoft Lists. Dit evenement bij Delta-N in Den Haag wordt vanaf 21:00 afgesloten met een borrel.ProductiviteitstipRaymond had last van dikke vingers deze week. Dit stond zijn genialiteit in Visual Studio dusdanig in de weg dat hij met Bing ging opzoeken hoe hij de tekstgrootte in Visual Studio kon aanpassen. Dit werkt in Visual Studio (nog) niet met de Ctrl-toets in combinatie met het scrollwiel… Op VS-Internationale toetsenborden werken wel de combinaties van Ctrl + - en Ctrl + =.In de Windows Terminal werken overigens beide methodes om tekstgrootte aan te passen. 😊De links bij deze shownotes zijn te vinden op https://itbros.nl/shows/s03a36",20.46,https://open.spotify.com/episode/5rne8QkUzzCpnCN8lJTNXh,['nl'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2023-10-06

Por otro lado os hago conocedores de aquello que me tiene ocupado: el evento del Tesoro de Aliseda. El Tesoro de Aliseda fue descubierto en el año 1920 en mi pueblo, ni que decir tiene que se llama Aliseda ;) en la provincia de Cáceres. Por azares del destino el Tesoro se encuentra en el Museo Arqueológico Nacional, en Madrid. En Aliseda, desde el año 2013, a principios de agosto recreamos el poblado que lo habitó en el s. VII a.C., fecha de la que data el Tesoro: hacemos escenificaciones, representamos oficios, labores, etc., y para finalizar representamos una obra de teatro. Este año el evento se celebra los días 6 y 7 de agosto.  Por último, comento una noticia que tiene que ver con la gran actualización de Windows 10, la del aniversario. Y es que restringirán más cosas en la última versión del sistema operativo de Microsoft, como por ejemplo el editor de políticas de grupo desde el que pueden configurarse las actualizaciones automáticas forzosas y controlar la publicidad en el menú de inicio. Ahora, aquellas personas que dispongan del Windows 10, se verán forzadas a soportar esas dos cosas :(  Muy mal Microsoft. De momento hasta el año 2023 estoy cubierto con Windows 8.1... después ya se verá.

3s3VDH5b3LxO3OWP6JTqEo,【歷史上的今天】1990-05-22 微軟發佈Windows 3.0 /  《微軟英雄》Pirates of Silicon Valley 的真實故事 | XXY,2020-05-23,#歷史上的今天 1990-MAY-22 Win. 3.0 發佈    30年前的今天，微軟公司出品了Windows3.0作業系統，是第一個獲得商業成功，並且能夠與蘋果公司的麥金塔電腦相抗衡的作業系統產品，也是控制台、小作家、小算盤、小畫家、接龍遊戲等經典輔助軟體問世的起點。    ▶ YouTube收看：  https://youtu.be/20zMuAxKMVU    Windows 3系列作業系統，以簡化的圖示程式管理檔案，也就是我們現今習慣操作的檔案總管始祖；而最廣泛使用的3.1版本，則是針對多媒體問題進行優化功能，同時加入了向量字型的修正。    在90年代到千禧年之際，可以說是PC霸佔電腦市場的天下，尤其是Windows 3系列作業系統推出後，更是讓微軟公司扶搖直上；直到千禧年後，史帝夫賈伯斯重返蘋果後，大刀闊斧地推出了諸如iphone、ipod等產品，才讓現在的3C市場逐漸被蘋果所佔據。    大家不妨參考1999年的電視電影《微軟英雄》，主要是描述賈伯斯與比爾蓋茲之間的鬥爭歷史；有趣的是，電影推出時的90年代，正值微軟的巔峰時期，電影故事也從兩位科技巨頭發跡開始描述到史蒂夫賈伯斯被趕出蘋果電腦做結尾，讓比爾蓋茲這個角色佔上風。    如今，若是要拍一部科技產品的電影，誰會想要拍比爾蓋茲呢？反而史蒂夫賈伯斯的電影還拍了兩部呢！可見，科技產品日新月異，誰知道下一個勝出者是誰？唯一能夠確定的是，停滯不前或是安於現狀的人，總是那個被淘汰的。    看完這則「歷史上的今天」你有什麼想法呢？    歡迎留言分享與我討論唷！    **************  歡迎加入【有梗電影俱樂部】，不錯過任何電影實體聚會與活動喔！  臉書社團（需回答問題審核）：https://www.facebook.com/groups/viewpointmovieclub/  Telegram群組：https://t.me/viewpointmovieclub2    PODCAST - Firstory APP  📣 XXY：https://open.firstory.me/user/xxymovie  📣 What A MAXX!：https://open.firstory.me/user/whatamaxx    別忘了按讚追蹤XXY視覺動物    📣 XXY視覺動物 YouTube頻道 http://pcse.pw/9ZNYT  📣 XXY @Yahoo頁面 https://tw.tv.yahoo.com/xxy/  📣 IG：xxy_djfishmb  📣 XXY @方格子 https://vocus.cc/user/@XXY2018    #電影 #歷史 #點評 #影評 #知識 #解析 #movie #history #微軟 #蘋果 #microsoft #windows #apple  Powered by Firstory Hosting,3.09,https://open.spotify.com/episode/3s3VDH5b3LxO3OWP6JTqEo,['zh'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2020-05-23

73nEFCXbEd1dVYyfU0DH5r,#105: David Bombal: How to Install Ubuntu on VirtualBox using Windows 10,2019-11-28,"Learn Linux! Learn VirtualBox! Learn Virtualization technologies. In this video, I'll show you how to install VirtualBox and then install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS within VirtualBox on a Windows 10 Laptop. VirtualBox is a type II hypervisor that allows you to run virtual machines directly on your Windows computer. No need to dual boot or struggle to learn Linux. Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distributions (distros) in the world. Even though Ubuntu 19.04 has been recently released I recommend you use Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) to get long term support.

52kwUt2MZOcXogPW9rLk7k,"Conversation with Author Lori Windows, a champion endurance rider who wrote the novel ""Simiakia""",2023-07-03,"I was very happy to have Lori Windows on the Keepin It Real w/ Caramel Podcast.  Lori Windows is a very interesting person to speak with. I really enjoyed our conversation. Actually, I had a wonderful conversation with Lori Windows. We spoke about riding horses, which I know, I will need Lori for help if I rode one of her horses. Lori Windows grew up enamored of the writings of Grey, Brand, Terhune, London, Burroughs, and Farley. Her father set her on a horse when she was two years old, and she has now ridden horses on six continents. In 1982, she discovered the sport of distance racing. She and her variety of horses and mules have amassed multiple national titles and more than 63,000 sanctioned race miles.  Lori decided to write a novel called ""Simiakia."" Simikia, the first novel by champion endurance rider Lori Windows, now available from Endless Sky Books, is a modern western (set in the 1980s in Idaho) that combines a deep love and understanding of horses (specifically Appaloosas) with adventure, Native American identity, the search for pride in oneself and one’s heritage, and a touch of romance. Raised without hope or pride in his heritage to what promises to be a short life of crime, alcohol, and drugs, Nez Perce teenager Al George gets an unexpected second chance. A heist gone wrong ends up with him working on probation at the very Idaho ranch he and his “friends” tried to rob, owned by Celia Bolt, who left her own rich-but-dysfunctional family to move West many years ago, and the taciturn Morgan Kyles, who has his own checkered past. Over the course of the summer of 1986, Celia and Morgan work out the thorny details of their relationship, while Al regains his pride and his sense of self as he works with the ranch’s signature Appaloosas, finds love—and finally, through a deep bond with one very special horse, reconnects with his Nez Perce heritage and discovers the truth of his strange, recurring dreams of an Indian brave on a very special horse, striving to protect his people from the soldiers pursuing them. For everyone involved, one summer changes everything. Lori speaks out.  “After fifty years of newspaper articles, magazine articles, and short stories, seeing my name in print attached to a work of my heart, a full novel, thrills me beyond belief. My friends say it is autobiographical,” says Lori Windows. “That may be true, but I am more related to the coydog in the story than I am the heroine.” About the Publisher: Endless Sky Books is a book-publishing company founded by award-winning author and editor Edward Willett in 2023. For more information, contact publisher@endless-sky-books.com or visit www.endless-sky-books.com.  “I’m delighted to be able to publish this exciting and ultimately life-affirming modern-day western,” says Edward Willett, editor and publisher of Endless Sky Books. “I can’t wait for readers to discover it. I hope they enjoy reading it as much as I did.”  If you want to purchase her book, you can go to Barnes & Noble and Amazon. You can follow Lori Windows on Facebook.

Rather than using a translation or compatibility layer between Linux and Windows which was used in WSL 1, WSL 2 uses virtual machine technology to allow you to run a real Linux kernel directly on Windows 10.

Les mostraremos como instalar Windows 11 23H2 sin necesidad de utilizar el narrador de Windows durante el proceso de instalación. La última versión del sistema operativo Windows 11, la 23H2, ha llegado con muchas novedades positivas.

Esto imposibilita a las personas que necesitamos de un lector de pantalla para poder interactuar con nuestro dispositivo Windows y realizar el proceso de instalación del sistema operativo  Alternativa accesible. Mientras que Microsoft saque alguna otra build con el problema solucionado, podemos utilizar un entorno accesible, tal como lo hacíamos para instalar Windows 7 u 8. ¿Qué es un entorno accesible? Es un entorno de preinstalación de Windows (WinPE) que ha sido personalizado para que sea más accesible para las personas con discapacidades. Esto se puede hacer mediante la adición de características y herramientas que facilitan el uso de WinPE para personas con problemas de visión, audición o movilidad. En nuestro caso, vamos a utilizar WinPE 10, que está basado en Windows 10 de 64 bits. Este entorno accesible cuenta con el lector de pantalla NVDA, el entorno accesible está en inglés, pero yo le cambié el idioma del NVDA al español, y le coloqué una voz en este mismo idioma. WinPE 10 también viene con algunas herramientas para la reparación del sistema, y soporta UEFI, necesario para instalar Windows 11.

This software is helpful since it can bypass the authentication of the software, which enables the operating system to function normally without requiring a genuine product key for activation.

Den er ekstremt skrabet mht. udstyr og vil kunne køres af 16-årige ligesom en 45-knallert. Elbilen er da også tænkt som et alternativ til el-løbehjul, og det er planen at udleje den på samme måde. Men ikke i Danmark. Windows 7 troede du måske var død og begravet, men sådan er det ikke på de danske hospitaler, hvor mange computere stadig kører på de gamle, usikre styresystemer. Det viser en række aktindsigter, Ingeniøren har fået hos regionerne. Tilsammen har de fem regioner 30.000 Windows 7-styrede maskiner, og i Region Sjælland gælder det for hver anden computer. Derefter kommer vi ind på et problem, der er blevet meget aktuelt med de store regnmængder denne vinter. I mange kommuner separerer man regnvand fra spildevand, men i byerne er man stødt på det problem, at veje og zink-tagrender foruener regnvandet med så høje koncentrationer af kemiske stoffer, at det ikke kan udledes til åer og søer uden at blive renset. Og på dette område findes der ingen klare regler for, hvor rent vandet skal være, inden det udledes. Vand er også emnet for ugens leder i Ingeniøren, hvor chefredaktør Trine Reitz Bjerregaard foreslår at udtage langt flere hektar ineffektive, lavtliggende landbrugsjorder, end man gør i dag, og i stedet bruge dem til opsamling af regnvand.

4cWnhyb8sm0GwjXDbOU4P4,A Guide To Asking Robots To Design Stained Glass Windows,2022-05-31," https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/a-guide-to-asking-robots-to-design I love stained glass. Not so much your usual suburban house stained glass with a picture of lilies. The good stuff. Cathedral windows, Art Nouveau, Art Deco. Why did we stop doing that? I blame the conspiracy. Recently I’ve been experimenting with small-scale alternatives. You can get custom-printed window film from these people. If you print out a picture of a stained glass scene and stick it on a window, it looks pretty realistic. But what scenes to use? Most of the stained glass images you can find are saints, which isn’t really the mood I’m going for. What I’d really like is a giant twelve-part panel depicting the Virtues Of Rationality. But the artists I’ve asked to design this all balk. I need an artist who works for free and isn’t allowed to say no. Enter DALL-E-2, the new art-generating AI. I’m still on the waitlist, but a friend who jumped in sooner than I did let me use their computer for a while and play around with it. This was my first introduction to the exciting world of DALL-E query framing - the surprisingly complicated relationship between what you ask the AI to do, and what it actually does. Seems on topic for this blog. So this is a combination investigation into how DALL-E thinks about queries, but also a practical guide to getting DALL-E to make good stained glass.

There seems to be a constant issue on both ends of the spectrum - that is, hustle versus self care.I was sick of the two feeling like polar opposites and constantly at the expense of the other, so this episode is my attempt to make sense of the hustle/self care spectrum, find where you sit on it, and help you own your own definitions of hard work. Once we have self awareness as to what hard work means to us, we can firstly, accept and own where we are, and two, pass less judgement towards others in their own ideals of business and hard work.I know that hustling is a badge of honour many of us like to wear, but how do we make it healthy, our own, and sustainable?

Bald erhältlich sind auch zahlreiche neue Nintendo-Spiele, darunter der Nachfolger von «Wii Sports». Schon jetzt ausprobieren kann man Android-Apps auf Windows 11. Aber lohnt sich das? Die letzte News betrifft ebenfalls Android, genauer gesagt das Werbetracking. Dort plant Google eine gewichtige Änderung.Als nächster Gang steht der Film «Licorice Pizza» auf dem Menü. Dort geht es aber nicht um das italienische Kultgericht, sondern um eine Coming of Age Story. Danach rechnen wir mit «Boba Fett» ab, das sogar durch die «Star Wars»-Fanbrille etwas blass wirkt. Eine positive Überraschung ist dafür «Uncharted», zumindest wenn man Luca glaubt, was wir immer tun.Vielleicht zu hoch waren die Erwartungen an «Horizon Forbidden West», das im Test nicht ganz überzeugen kann.

4DJhUbV1UZPp04hENKvDpu,104: Open Windows (Mitch v Andy),2020-05-28,"  HEY! Rejoice! For better or worse it looks like lockdown is easing a little. Things are looking up, y'all! Well, that is until the next inevitable lockdown! BUT that's a ballache for the future. We are focused on the here, the now, on EPISODE 104!  Anyway, our guest this week is a RETURNING guest. A horror writer, an occasional doer of musical things and one of the hosts of the podcast STRONG LANGUAGE & VIOLENT SCENES...  It's MITCH BAIN! His chosen film? OPEN WINDOWS! We all know Mitch loves a tech-horror. That's no secret. So it should come as no surprise to learn that he has gone for TimeCrimes and Colossal director Nacho Vigalondo's 2014 ""webcam"" mystery, Open Windows! This might well be a contentious issue as we did into the film, which stars Elijah Wood, Sasha Grey and Neil Maskell! Can Mitch come out on top and win Andy round? Dive in and see!  The synopsis is as follows:  An actress refuses to have dinner with a fan who won a date with her in an Internet contest.   In return, a man posing as her campaign manager, helps the winner to follow in the footsteps of the actress from his own computer.  Please note that this episode contains strong language, conversations of an adult nature and EXTREMELY Scottish accents.  Remember, you can keep up to date with our news by following us via the usual social media outlets:  Facebook (including our group THE CHUD LOCKER!) Twitter Instagram Plus you can drop us an email to stronglanguageviolentscenes@gmail.com AND visit our website!   Strong Language & Violent Scenes theme by Mitch Bain.

Richard talks to Michael Niehaus about the upcoming end of support for Windows 10 in 2025 and the pressure to get to Windows 11.

But as of October 14, 2025, organizations will have to pay for long-term support - and it's cheaper to move to Windows 11.

One person who preached caution and less hyperbole was Economics Professor, Russian-Irish man and tortoise shack regular, Constantin Gurdgiev. He rejoins us to talk about the implications for Putin, Wagner ""CEO"" Yevgeni Progozhin, Ukraine and the rest of us. He explains the Kremlin power dynamics, the rise of Progozhin from hotdog salesman to mercenary army war criminal and who needs to stay away from tall buildings. Then we dive into what systemic corruption does to the concept of accountability via the lens of both the incompetent coup and RTE's week from hell.

6hX7YJKx8IbX6fLL6AA2O5,Como instalar Subsistema de Windows para Android en Windows 10 y 11! ,2023-08-30,"¡Hoy muy atentos, el compañero Libardo Nova nos trae el subsistema de Windows para Android 10 y 11 en el 2023! ¿Qué es Windows Subsistem for Android (subsistema de Windows para Android)? El subsistema de Windows para Android es una característica que permite a los usuarios de Windows ejecutar aplicaciones de Android en sus ordenadores. El subsistema de Windows para Android (WSA) es una tecnología de virtualización que permite ejecutar aplicaciones Android en Windows 11. WSA está basado en la tecnología de contenedores, que permite ejecutar un sistema operativo completo dentro de un entorno aislado. Subsistema de Windows para Android es una característica que nos permite instalar y ejecutar aplicaciones de Android en Windows 10 y 11 para usarlas de manera independiente, como cualquier otra aplicación de Windows que se abre en una ventana propia.  En otras palabras, esta aplicación proporciona en Windows un entorno de virtualización de Android que nos permite conectarnos e instalar aplicaciones desde la Play Store, además de permitirnos instalarlas desde archivos .APK para usarlas en nuestro computador como cualquier otro programa de Windows 11.  Notas: 1) Si ya hemos instalado desde la tienda de Microsoft, el subsistema oficial de Windows para Android, debemos desinstalarlo por completo para poder instalar el que descargamos del repositorio de GitHub  2) Si tenemos instalada una versión anterior del subsistema (oficial o modificada) y queremos conservar los datos de esa instalación, podemos hacer una copia de seguridad del archivo ""userdata.vhdx"" y restaurarlo después de la instalación. La ruta completa donde se encuentra es:  ""C:\Users\nombre_de_usuario\AppData\Local\Packages\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\userdata.vhdx"" 3) Para evitar conflictos, se recomienda cambiar el nombre de la carpeta descargada por un nombre corto, por ejemplo, WSA.  4) Si está actualizando WSA, combine la carpeta descargada con la existente en la computadora, y reemplace los archivos de todos los elementos cuando se le solicite.  5) Toda la información para el subsistema, se encuentra en el repositorio de GitHub: Requisitos, instalación, manejo de errores, actualización, desinstalación, etc.  Notas:  1) Para instalar aplicaciones desde archivos .apk o .xapk, no es necesario tener abierto el WSA Package Manager. Simplemente pulsamos Intro sobre el archivo a instalar.  2) Pero si deben estar abiertas la ventana principal del subsistema y el subsistema mismo. Después de la instalación se pueden cerrar. Cabe recalcar también que la versión de Android que utiliza este subsistema es la 13.

The Next Stop: Pismo Beach, CA is a beautiful town to visit in an RV. It is a great place to take the family and enjoy the sand dunes and the great Pacific Ocean. The weather is great most of the year and there is no shortage of activities to keep the family busy. There are great places to eat, everything the beach has to offer, sand dunes, ATVing, RV parks next to the ocean and so much more. It is also a great place to use as a hub to plan some day trips or visit other nearby places. More About Pismo Beach...

O quanto a gigante pode se ver ameaçada não por outros sistemas operacionais, mas sim por novos ecossistemas de hardware? E as novidades trazidas pela nova versão do Windows? A empresa promete maior integração com o universo mobile e com sua plataforma de games Xbox, o que pode representar uma grande mudança de paradigma e também uma ameaça para outras empresas como Valve e Sony.  E sobre a adoção do novo Windows: quais são os novos recursos trazidos pelo novo sistema e, principalmente, quais as necessidades de hardware para quem pretende fazer a atualização? Será que a mudança vale a pena por agora ou será melhor esperar para acompanhar um pouco mais da maturação do novo software?

0Q6P5CaEoVCKmRmzycZzG2,Windows 11- wir sprechen mit Jana Tappendorf über Mehrwerte und Chancen!,2023-10-03,"Im ganzen Channel ist Jana Tappendorf bekannt und beliebt. Heute erfährst du nochmal einige persönliche  Dinge von Jana, die du vielleicht heute noch nicht gewusst hast. Wir nehmen comTeam Partner in den nächsten Jahren mit unserem comTeam POP (Partner Onboarding Programm) mit in die Zukunft und zeigen auf, wie IT Systemhäuser mit Microsoft bei ihren Kunden erfolgreich sein können. Es ist wichtige sich jetzt mit den Themen und Möglichkeiten zu beschäftigen.   Windows 11 – warum sollte ein Unternehmen umsteigen? Viele Unternehmen im deutschen Mittelstand sind bereits Opfer von Cyberkriminellen geworden. Besonders hervorzuheben sind hier veraltete Softwareversionen, die diesen Bedrohungen nicht standhalten können. Bis zum 14.10.25 wird Windows 10 noch mit Updates unterstützt, die auf aktuelle Sicherheitsbedrohungen eingehen. Das dauert noch ewig und man hat viel Zeit? Dein Alltag wird dich eines Besseren belehren. Zeitgemäße und hochwirksame Sicherheitskomponenten direkt aus dem Produktportfolio ohne Drittanbieter können viel Geld und Zeit sparen! Und meistens ist die Microsoft Lizenz schon da, die Angebote werden oft nicht genutzt!   Zero-Trust Szenarien leben und umsetzen! Mit Windows 11 besteht die Möglichkeit modernes Sicherheits- und Identitätsmanagement zu betreiben. Im gesamten Produktportfolio stehe viele Möglichkeiten zur Verfügung. „Vertrauen ist gut, Kontrolle ist besser!“ so fasst dies Jana zusammen. Das Produktportfolio bietet eine Vielzahl an integrierten Möglichkeiten und Ansätzen, die den Sicherheitslevel eines Unternehmens sehr einfach und schnell deutlich anheben können. Erwähnung sollte der Microsoft Authenticator finden, der 2FA im Unternehmen schnell und einfach etabliert.   Modernes Arbeiten und Chance M365 Produktportfolio Endkunden haben mittlerweile gehobene Anforderungen und wünschen deutlich mehr Beratung. Eine tolle Chance für das IT Systemhaus, in den nächsten Jahren sein Beratungsbusiness auf diese Bedürfnisse auszurichten. Die Zusammenarbeit mit Kollegen und Kunden an Projekten, zu jeder Zeit, an jedem Ort, steht immer noch hoch im Kurs und benötigt ebenso Anwendungen und Sicherheitskonzepte.   KI, Copilot, Automatisierung KI wird in der Zukunft viele neue Möglichkeiten bieten. Informationen und Inhalte werden zusammengefasst oder Präsentationen entstehen aus internen Daten und können dann zur Verfügung gestellt werden. ChatGPT & Co. zeigen diese Entwicklung und Vorteile momentan schon ein wenig auf. Demnächst nutzen wir diese wie selbstverständlich auch im Unternehmen. Aber auch hier gibt es einige Dinge zu beachten und auch das Thema Sicherheit und Datenschutz muß bedacht werden. Der Mensch wird aber nie zu ersetzen sein und immer am Schluß die Ergebnisse prüfen müssen.    LinkedIn Kontakt zu Jana Tappendorf: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jana-tappendorf-0493b07a/   Anmeldung zum kostenfreien DPSC Netzwerk: https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR-ulbGFJfw9Fm1o1p91DmhhUREZQNkEzWEVOSDZHTUkxWEsyNlgzODBSSy4u",31.16,https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Q6P5CaEoVCKmRmzycZzG2,['de-DE'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['lung'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['man'],[],2023-10-03

2M48ooDyTjmPTXjazluOZp,ATA 107 - SSH desde Windows con MobaXterm,2019-09-16,"Creo que lo he comentado en algún que otro episodio del podcast. Pero, sea como fuere, la cuestión, en el trabajo tengo que utilizar Windows. Esto tiene dos problemas para mi. Por un lado que no me encuentro tan cómodo como me encontraría si estuviera con Linux. Si fuera Ubuntu, mejor, pero esto sería con independencia de la distribución. Por otro lado, es que al final me tengo que conectar a máquinas Linux vía SSH. En este sentido, hasta hace algo mas de un año, había estado utilizando herramientas como Putty. Sin embargo, por aquel entonces MobaXterm entró a formar parte de mis aplicaciones habituales y mejoró sensiblemente mi productividad.  Y es que MobaXterm, no se limita a ser una simple herramienta para conectarte con una máquina. Se trata de toda una caja de herramientas en una sola aplicación.  Probablemente si te dedicas a trabajar y gestionar máquinas Linux, es muy probable que ya conozcas esta herramienta. Pero, si no conoces MobaXterm, y tal y como vengo recomendando en los últimos episodios del podcast, pausa este episodio de inmediato, abre tu equipo con Windows, descarga MobaXterm, y luego vuelve al podcast.     SSH desde Windows con MobaXterm  Aviso para caminantes  Antes de meterme en harina, y como siempre intento hacer en estos casos una advertencia importante. MobaXterm no software libre.  Pero no solo esto, si no que dependiendo de la licencia que escojas, tampoco es una aplicación gratuita. Sin embargo, por el precio que tiene, 49 €, creo sinceramente que vale mucho la pena.  Ahora bien, te recomiendo que antes de que te embarques en la compra de este software lo pruebes suficientemente, y veas si se adapta a tus requerimientos, necesidades y sobre todo a tu forma de trabajar.  Diferencias entre la licencia gratuita y de pago  Básicamente la diferencia entre la licencia gratuita y la de pago radica en las limitaciones de la primera de ellas. Esto es,  Solo permite un máximo de 12 sesionesEl número máximo de túneles SSH es de 2Solo puedes utilizar hasta 4 macrosTendrás limitaciones de tiempo para determinados servicios, como puede ser NFS y Cron. Básicamente lo limita a 6 minutos.  ¿Que es MobaXterm?  Como te adelantaba en la introducción de este episodio del podcast, MobaXterm es toda una caja de herramientas. Una caja de herramientas pensadas tanto para administradores de sistemas como para desarrolladores. Pero no solo para ellos, si no que también y por supuesto, está pensada en cualquier usuario que necesite tener diferentes sesiones remotas en una sola aplicación y de forma cómoda, práctica y sencilla.  MobaXterma pone al alcance de tus dedos, diferentes herramientas y protocolos para conectarte de forma remota con tus máquinas Linux. Herramientas y protocolos como SSH, RDP, VNC, FTP, y mas.  Pero no solo esto, también encontrás una gran cantidad de comandos GNU/Linux, con los que estás habituado a trabajar. Así, encontrarás un Bash y todos los comandos necesarios para trabajar en tu equipo Windows como si estuvieras en una máquina Linux.

0NhuvE6wkVhOnZQlBCYluc,S2:E12 | Cybersecurity and Teleworking Part II - What Does Windows 11 Mean To You? | Compliance In Context,2022-02-01,"Welcome back to the Compliance In Context Podcast! On today’s show, we welcome the return of former NSCP Board Chair and all-around compliance expert, Craig Watanabe, to analyze some recent comments from SEC Chair Gensler around cybersecurity, and reveal some practical tips firms can use to enhance the cybersecurity measures inside their own firms. In our Headlines section, we look at the new NSCP Firm and CCO Liability Framework and its broader application to the industry. And finally, we wrap up today’s show with another installment of What’s On My Mind where we examine what an 80s classic song from Mike and the Mechanics and the life of John Madden can teach us about being the best compliance officer and CCO for your respective firms.   Headlines  NSCP Firm and CCO Liability Framework    Interview  Reaction to SEC Chair Gensler’s Speech at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law’s Annual Securities Regulation Institute Reviewing “Twelve Tips for Teleworking Cybersecurity” in May 2020 edition of Currents What is the Windows 11 upgrade? Usability vs. Security What is the Trusted Platform Module? What are the best tips for cybersecurity and user awareness training? What is cyber hygiene? What are some other best practices you’ve seen in cybersecurity lately? How best to leverage cyber insurance and related expertise?    What’s On My Mind?  “Living Years” by Mike + The Mechanics The Life of John Madden Fastidious preparation as compliance coach Living with a sense of appreciation    Quotes:  “Cybersecurity is almost always at the top or near the top of the list in terms of risks and I think that’s going to be the case for some time for this foreseeable future so it’s going to be a big risk for everyone, a big risk for the industry.” – Craig Watanabe   10:12 - “I think Regulation SP is somewhat of a misnomer because the S stands for safeguarding and the P stands for privacy. But if you ask most people, ‘Reg SP?’ ‘Oh, yeah! Privacy.’ We kinda forget Section 30, which is the safeguarding part of the rule. And that’s where all cybersecurity regulation basically resides.” – Craig Watanabe “In the Fortress Model, the idea is you create this fortress. Everything on the inside of the fortress, all the interior is safe and you try to keep all the unknowns (all the bad stuff) out. That model works really well when you have a centralized work environment and you have a centralized IP. It’s a perfectly reasonable, very usable, and a very functional model. That model, however, doesn’t work as well in a remote or hybrid work environment.” – Craig Watanabe  “I think there has been a paradigm shift at Microsoft and other big vendors, with an emphasis on security. That’s clear to me. I don’t think Microsoft would have done these things prior.” – Craig Watanabe     Resources: Compliance in Context Contact Form  Compliance in Context, LinkedIn  Twitter: @compliancepod  ",68.89,https://open.spotify.com/episode/0NhuvE6wkVhOnZQlBCYluc,['en'],Spotify,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],2022-02-01
